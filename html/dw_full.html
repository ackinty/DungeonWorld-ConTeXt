      <h1>Dungeon World</h1>

      <div id="Introduction">
        <p class="NoIndent">Dungeon World is a world of fantastic
        adventure. A world of magic, gods, demons, Good and Evil.
        Brave heroes venture into the most dangerous corners of the
        land in search of gold and glory.</p>

        <p>You are those heroes. You go where others can't or
        won't. You conquer the unbeatable and laugh in the face of
        Death. There are monstrous things lurking in the world. Are
        you ready to face them?</p>

        <h2>The Bard</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Sure, an adventurer&rsquo;s life is all
        open roads and the glory of coin and combat. Those tales
        that are told in every farmhand-filled inn have to have
        some ring of truth to them, don&rsquo;t they? The songs to
        inspire peasantry and royals alike&mdash;to soothe the
        savage beast or drive men to a frenzy have to come from
        somewhere.</p>

        <p>Enter the Bard. You, with your smooth tongue and quick
        wit. You teller-of-tales and singer-of-songs. It takes a
        mere minstrel to retell a thing but a true Bard to live it.
        Strap on your boots, noble orator. Sharpen that hidden
        dagger and take up the call. Someone&rsquo;s got to be
        there, fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with the goons and the
        thugs and the soon-to-be-heroes. Who better than you to
        write the tale of your own heroism?</p>

        <p>Nobody. Get going.</p>

        <h2>The Cleric</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">The lands of Dungeon World are a
        gods-forsaken mess. They&rsquo;re lousy with the walking
        dead, beasts of all sorts, and the vast unnatural spaces
        between safe and temple-blessed civilizations. It is a
        godless world out there. That&rsquo;s why it needs you.</p>

        <p>Bringing the glory of your god to the heathens isn't
        just in your nature&mdash;it's your calling. It falls to
        you to proselytize with sword and mace and spell. To cleave
        deep into the witless heart of the wilds and plant the seed
        of divinity there. Some say that it is best to keep god
        close to your heart. You know that&rsquo;s rubbish. God
        lives at the edge of a blade. Show the world who is
        lord.</p>

        <h2>The Fighter</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">It&rsquo;s a thankless job&mdash;living
        day to day by your armor and the skill of your arm. To dive
        heedlessly into danger. They won&rsquo;t be playing golden
        horns for the time you took that knife to the ribs for them
        in the bar in Bucksberg. No flock of angels to sing of the
        time you dragged them, still screaming, from the edge of
        the Pits of Madness, no.</p>

        <p>Forget them.</p>

        <p>You do this for the guts and the glory. The scream of
        battle and the hot hot blood of it. You are a beast of
        iron. Your friends may carry blades of forged steel but,
        Fighter, you are steel. While your traveling companions
        might moan about their wounds over a campfire in the
        wilderness, you bear your scars with pride.</p>

        <p>You are the wall&mdash;let every danger smash itself to
        nothing on you. In the end, you&rsquo;ll be the last one
        standing.</p>

        <h2>The Paladin</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Hell awaits. An eternity of torment in
        fire or ice or whatever best suits the sins of the damned
        throngs of Dungeon World. All that stands between the pits
        of that grim torture and salvation is you. Holy man,
        armored war machine, templar of the Good and the Light,
        right? The Cleric may say his prayers at night to the gods,
        dwelling in their heavens. The Fighter may wield his sharp
        sword in the name of &ldquo;good&rdquo; but you know. Only
        you.</p>

        <p>Eyes, hands, and sweet killing blow of the gods, you
        are. Yours is the gift of righteousness and virtue. Of
        justice. Vision, too. A purity of intent that your
        companions do not have. So guide these fools, Paladin. Take
        up your holy cause and bring salvation to the wastrel
        world.</p>

        <p>Vae victis, right?</p>

        <h2>The Ranger</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">These city-born folk you travel with.
        Have they heard the call of the wolf? Felt the winds howl
        in the bleak deserts of the East? Have they hunted their
        prey with the bow and the knife like you? Hell no.
        That&rsquo;s why they need you.</p>

        <p>Guide. Hunter. Creature of the wilds. You are these
        things and more. Your time in the wilderness may have been
        solitary until now, the call of some greater thing &ndash;
        call it fate if you like, has cast your lot with these
        folk. Brave, they may be. Powerful and strong, too. You
        know the secrets of the spaces-between, though.</p>

        <p>Without you, they&rsquo;d be lost. Blaze a trail through
        the blood and dark, strider.</p>

        <h2>The Thief</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">You&rsquo;ve heard them, sitting around
        the campfire. Bragging about this battle or that. About how
        their gods are smiling on your merry band. You count your
        coins and smile to yourself&mdash;this is the thrill above
        all. You alone know the secret of Dungeon World: filthy
        filthy lucre.</p>

        <p>Sure, they give you lip for all the times you&rsquo;ve
        snuck off alone but without you, who among them
        wouldn&rsquo;t have been dissected by a flying guillotine
        or poisoned straight to death by some ancient needle-trap?
        So let them complain. When you&rsquo;re done with all this
        delving you&rsquo;ll toast their heroes' graves.</p>

        <p>From your castle. Full of gold. You rogue.</p>

        <h2>The Wizard</h2>

        <p>Dungeon World has rules. Not the laws of men or the rule
        of some petty tyrant. Bigger, better rules. You drop
        something&mdash;it falls. You can&rsquo;t make something
        out of nothing. The dead stay dead, right?</p>

        <p>Oh, the things we tell ourselves to feel better about
        the long, dark nights.</p>

        <p>You&rsquo;ve spent so very long poring over those tomes
        of yours. The experiments that nearly drove you mad and all
        the botched summonings that endangered your very soul. For
        what? For power. What else is there? Not just the power of
        King or Country but the power to boil a man's blood in his
        veins. To call on the thunder of the sky and the churn of
        the roiling earth. To shrug off the rules the world holds
        so dear.</p>

        <p>Let them cast their sidelong glances. Let them call you
        &ldquo;warlock&rdquo; or &ldquo;diabolist.&rdquo; Who among
        them can hurl fireballs from their eyes?</p>

        <p>Yeah. We didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>
      </div>

      <h1>Setting Up</h1>

      <p class="NoIndent">To play Dungeon World, you'll need to
      gather yourself and 2&ndash;5 friends. A group of 4 to 5,
      including you, is best. Choose one person to be the
      GameMaster (hereafter: GM). Everyone else will be players,
      taking the role of the characters in the game. The players
      get to say what their characters say, think, and do. The GM
      describes everything else in the world.</p>

      <p>You can play a single session or string together multiple
      sessions into a campaign. Plan accordingly. Each session will
      usually be a few hours and you'll be able to start playing
      right away within the first session.</p>

      <p>You'll need to print some materials. Before you start a
      new game, print off at least:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A few copies of the basic and special moves</li>

        <li>One copy of each class sheet</li>

        <li>One copy each of the cleric and wizard spell
        sheets</li>

        <li>One copy of the adventure sheet and GM moves</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Everyone at the table will need something to write with
      and some six-sided dice. Two dice is the minimum but two dice
      per player is a good idea.</p>

      <p>You'll also need some specialized dice: four-sided,
      eight-sided, and ten-sided. One of each is enough but more is
      better; you won't have to pass them around so much.</p>

      <h2>Using Dice</h2>

      <p class="NoIndent">When talking about dice,
      <strong>dX</strong> means a dice with X sides (d4, d6, d8,
      etc.). A number before the dice size means "roll this many
      and add them together," so 2d6 means "roll two six-sided dice
      and add them together." Sometimes you'll add something to the
      roll, maybe a static number or the result of another roll,
      add that to the total. If there's a "&middot;b" at the end
      instead of adding them together you take the best one ('b'
      for 'best'), so 2d6&middot;b+1 means "roll two six-sided dice
      and take the best one and add one to it." A "&middot;w" at
      the end means you take the worst result, so 2d6&middot;w
      means "roll two six-sided dice and take the worst one."</p>

      <h1>The Flow of Play</h1>

      <p class="NoIndent">Playing Dungeon World is a conversation
      of sorts; I say something, then you reply, maybe someone else
      chimes in. We talk about the fiction, what's happening to the
      characters we imagine and the world around them. We also talk
      about the rules, how they come from and lead back to the
      fiction. There are no turns or rounds in Dungeon World, no
      forced order of when people talk, but a conversation means
      taking turns. Dungeon World is never a monologue, always a
      conversation.</p>

      <p>The rules shape the conversation. While the GM and the
      players are having a conversation the rules and the fiction
      are having a conversation too. The rules affect the game when
      the fiction triggers them and a rule will always tell you
      when it's meant to trigger.</p>

      <h2>Moves</h2>

      <p class="NoIndent">The basic unit of rules in Dungeon World
      is the <strong>Move</strong>. A move looks like this:</p>

      <p class="Example">When you <strong>attack an enemy in
      melee</strong>, roll+Str. On a 10+ you deal your damage to
      the enemy and avoid their attack. At your option, you may
      choose to do +1d6 damage but expose yourself to the enemy's
      attack. On a 7&ndash;9, you deal your damage to the enemy and
      the enemy makes an attack against you.</p>

      <p>Moves are rules that describe when they trigger and what
      effect they have. A move always depends on a fictional action
      and always has some fictional effect. "Fictional" means that
      the action and effect come from the shared imaginative space
      we're describing, not from us directly. In the move above,
      the trigger is "when you attack an enemy in melee." The
      effect is what follows: a roll to be made and differing
      fictional effects based on the outcome of the roll. Most
      moves rely on one of a character's <strong>stats</strong>
      which represent the character's innate abilities.</p>

      <p>When a player says their character does something that
      triggers a move that move happens and its rules apply. Moves
      and dealing damage are the only times dice are rolled. The
      move will tell you what dice to roll.</p>

      <p>The basic rule of moves is: <strong>take the action to
      gain the effect</strong>. To make the mechanical aspect of a
      move happen the character has to do something that triggers
      that move. Likewise, if the character does something that
      triggers a move the mechanical portion happens.</p>

      <h3>Moves Are Indivisible</h3>

      <p class="NoIndent">A character can't take the fictional
      action that triggers a move without that move occurring. For
      example, if Isaac tells the GM that his character dashes past
      a crazed, axe-wielding orc to the open door he makes the Defy
      Danger move because its trigger is "when you act despite an
      imminent threat". Isaac can't just have his character run
      past the orc without making the Defy Danger move and he can't
      make the Defy Danger move without acting despite an imminent
      threat. The moves and the fiction go hand-in-hand to make up
      the game. When a move is made it falls to the GM and players
      to make sure that both of these things (fiction and rules)
      happen.</p>

      <p>Taking a fictional action that should trigger a move and
      not applying it looks like this: Ben says "I run past the orc
      to the door," but doesn't make the Defy Danger move. In this
      case, the GM should suggest that the move applies: "So you're
      Defying the Danger of the crazed orc as he swings at you?"
      Ben then has to be a real adventurer and Defy Danger or back
      off and do something else; he can't take action that triggers
      the move without making the move. He can't "just" run past
      the orc without making the move that applies.</p>

      <p>Trying to apply a move without taking the action that
      makes the move occur happens when a player jumps straight to
      the effects of the move. The Hack and Slash move has damage
      as one of its effects. Dan can't just say "I'm Hacking and
      Slashing! I rolled +Str and got a 10, I do 1d8 damage." That
      doesn't work because his character hasn't taken any fictional
      action. "Hack and Slash" isn't something a character
      does&mdash;it's a rule that happens when the character
      fulfills its trigger. The GM's response should be "okay, how
      do you do that?" or "what does that look like?"</p>

      <p>The GM's questions are there to refine the action, not to
      deny it. It's still a conversation. The GM asks to make sure
      the everyone understands what's happening and the moves
      involved.</p>

      <p>Some moves work a little differently&mdash;they just
      provide a bonus all the time. These moves are still saying
      something fictionally and mechanically. They're saying
      something the character is or has. For example, the Thief
      move Cautious gives a constant bonus. That's still a move,
      it's just one that's always happening; the Thief is
      particularly careful when looking for signs of traps. Maybe
      they've learned their lesson from being caught in a trap
      before.</p>

      <h2>Rolls and Results</h2>

      <p class="NoIndent">Once a move applies, it's time to look at
      the effects. Most moves tell you to roll+something. The
      <strong>roll</strong> part means to take two d6s, roll them,
      and add them together. The <strong>+something</strong> part
      means to add the modifier associated with that stat. So, a
      character with Dex modifier of +2 who launches a Volley rolls
      two d6s, adds them together, and adds two. Easy.</p>

      <p>The result of the roll falls into three categories: a 10+
      is a <strong>strong hit</strong>. A 7&ndash;9 is a
      <strong>weak hit</strong>. A 6- is a
      <strong>miss</strong>.</p>

      <p>Strong hits and weak hits are both <strong>hits</strong>.
      A hit means the character does what they set out to, more or
      less. A strong hit means they do it without much trouble or
      complications. A weak hit means complications and
      unpleasantries. Sometimes, a weak hit will mean you need to
      make a hard decision about what to do next. The move will
      always say what to do for a strong and weak hit.</p>

      <p>A miss means that the character's action is unsuccessful
      or carries major consequences. Unless the move tells you what
      to do, all moves work the same on a miss&mdash;the GM takes
      action, doing something dangerous to the characters.</p>

      <h2>Terminology</h2>

      <p class="NoIndent">Some moves use the phrase "<strong>deal
      damage</strong>." Dealing damage means you roll the damage
      dice for your class and modify it based on the weapon you
      were using for that move. You have to be wielding a weapon to
      use your class's damage dice. Default damage without a weapon
      is 1.</p>

      <p>Some moves say "take +1 <strong>forward</strong>." That
      means to take +1 to your next move roll (not damage). The
      bonus can be greater than +1, or even a penalty, like -1.
      There also might be a condition, such as "take +1 forward to
      Hack and Slash," in which case the bonus applies only to the
      next time you roll Hack and Slash, not any other move.</p>

      <p>Some moves say "take +1 <strong>ongoing</strong>." That
      means to take +1 to all move rolls (not damage). The bonus
      can be larger than +1, or it can be a penalty, like -1. There
      also might be a condition, such as "take +1 ongoing to
      Volley." An ongoing bonus also says what causes it to end,
      like "until you dismiss the spell" or "until you atone to
      your deity."</p>

      <p>Some moves give you <strong>hold</strong>. Hold is
      currency that allows you to make some choices later on by
      spending the hold as the move describes. Hold is always saved
      up for the move that generated it; you can't spend your hold
      from Defend on Trap Sense or vice versa.</p>

      <p>There are some moves that all the players have access to.
      These are the <strong>Basic</strong> and
      <strong>Special</strong> moves. Basic moves are the things
      that happen often&mdash;players will roll these a lot.
      Special moves are moves that come up less frequently, but
      everyone has access to them.</p>

      <p>Each class also has some of its own moves. Some of these
      moves are <strong>starting moves</strong> that the class
      starts with. Others are <strong>advanced moves</strong> that
      the player may choose as their character grows.</p>

      <h2>Stats</h2>

      <p class="NoIndent">The basic stats are:</p>

      <p><strong>Strength</strong> (Str). The character's physical
      force and muscle. Used for moves in melee combat and breaking
      things.</p>

      <p><strong>Dexterity</strong> (Dex). The character's
      precision and aim. Used for moves in ranged combat and
      avoiding things.</p>

      <p><strong>Constitution</strong> (Con). The character's
      health and ability to take a beating. Used for moves that
      endure things and surviving dangers.</p>

      <p><strong>Intelligence</strong> (Int). The character's
      accumulated knowledge and logical thinking. Used for moves
      that rely on remembered facts and casting some kinds of
      spells.</p>

      <p><strong>Wisdom</strong> (Wis). The character's keen senses
      and mental defenses. Used for moves that rely on noticing
      things and casting some kinds of spells.</p>

      <p><strong>Charisma</strong> (Cha). The character's force of
      personality and charm. Used for social moves.</p>

      <p>Each basic stat has a <strong>score</strong> from 3 to 18
      and a <strong>modifier</strong> from -3 to +3. When a stat is
      spelled out (like "Strength") that refers to the score, when
      the three letter abbreviation (like "Str") is used it refers
      to the modifier. The stat's modifier depends on the stat's
      score:</p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Score</th>

          <th>Modifier</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>1&ndash;3</td>

          <td>-3</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>4&ndash;5</td>

          <td>-2</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>6&ndash;8</td>

          <td>-1</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>9&ndash;11</td>

          <td>0</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>12&ndash;15</td>

          <td>+1</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>16-17</td>

          <td>+2</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>18</td>

          <td>+3</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>There are also a few special stats:</p>

      <p><strong>Bond</strong> is how well your character knows
      another character. You use Bond to aid another character or
      interfere with their actions. Bond is about knowledge and not
      about how well you get along or how similar you are. Bond may
      also be asymmetrical: the Fighter might know the Wizard very
      well, but the Wizard doesn't pay much attention to the
      Fighter. Your Bond with someone starts based on your history
      with them. Each class has starting bonds with blanks to fill
      in names. When you roll+Bond, count the number of Bonds you
      have with that person and add that to the roll.</p>

      <p><strong>Level</strong> reflects how your character has
      grown. Your character starts at level 1, and may advance all
      the way to level 10. Your level tracks how far you've grown.
      As you advance in level you gain new moves.</p>

      <h2>Equipment</h2>

      <p class="NoIndent">Every adventurer needs stuff: weapons,
      spellbooks, armor, holy symbols, and the like. Each item says
      what it does. In general, weapons define the way a character
      deals damage with it and at what range they can do that
      damage. Armor and shields reduce damage taken. Other items
      have various effects.</p>

      <p>Items say what they do through their
      <strong>tags</strong>. A tag is a word or phrase that
      indicates some common ability the item possess. The Messy
      tag, for example, means the weapon does damage in a
      particularly devastating way.</p>

      <p>All items, unless otherwise noted, are
      <strong>mundane</strong>. They're not magical in any way.
      Some items are enchanted&mdash;they work through arcane or
      divine tricks. These magic items are tougher to get, tougher
      to destroy, and more powerful to use.</p>

      <p>Characters are limited in how much they can carry by their
      <strong>Load</strong>. Load is determined by class. Carrying
      items whose total weight is more than your load causes
      problems.</p>

      <p>Some classes have other specific tools at their disposal
      like custom gear or ties to powerful entities or
      organizations. The rules for these are detailed with each
      class.</p>

      <h2>Damage and HP</h2>

      <p class="NoIndent">Dungeon World is a dangerous place in
      many ways, not least of which are the physical perils that
      await in the forgotten halls where adventurers explore. Each
      character has <strong>HP</strong>. HP is short for hit
      points; it's a number which reflects a character's condition.
      The character's HP value is determined by their class and
      Constitution score. Your HP doesn't automatically go up as
      you level, but if your Constitution score changes you update
      your HP as well.</p>

      <p>When a character takes <strong>damage</strong> they reduce
      their current HP by that amount. If their current HP falls to
      zero it means they're dying and must immediately make the
      Last Breath move. HP never goes negative; if damage would
      take a character's HP below zero set it to zero instead.</p>

      <p>Depending on the outcome of the Last Breath move a
      character may be <strong>stable</strong> at 0 HP. Stable
      means the character won't get worse on their own but they
      won't get better without care or time. If a stable character
      takes damage they stay at 0 HP but must make the Last Breath
      move again immediately.</p>

      <p>Armor prevents damage. When you take damage you subtract
      your armor from the damage dealt.</p>

      <p>The Cleric is all about healing HP. Without the Cleric's
      healing magics, adventurers are left at the mercies of
      bandages, poultices, and other crude medicines, plus the odd
      healing potion.</p>

      <p>HP tracks the assorted bruises and cuts that accumulate
      but some wounds go deeper. These are
      <strong>debilities</strong>. Debilities give you a -1 to your
      modifier for one stat. They don't effect the base score (so
      being Weak won't effect your Load, just your Str modifier).
      They're tougher to heal than HP, your best bet is to get
      somewhere safe and spend a few days resting to get rid of
      them.</p>

      <h2>Advancement</h2>

      <p class="NoIndent">Adventurers in Dungeon World grow and
      learn from their experiences. Eventually, with time and luck,
      they survive to level up.</p>

      <p>Experience is tracked via <strong>XP</strong>. Players
      mark XP by keeping a tally on their character sheet. When
      they have XP marks equal to their current level + 7 they are
      ready to level up, but they do not actually level up until
      they have some downtime (usually in camp or in a nearby
      village). Gaining a new level means choosing a new move from
      your class. If your new level is 3rd, 6th, or 9th you also
      get to increase one stat by 2, adjusting the modifier to
      reflect the new score.</p>

      <p>There are two times when you mark XP: when you roll a miss
      (6-) and when you make the End of Session move.</p>

      <p>Whenever you roll a miss (a 6 or lower) when making a move
      you mark XP. These are the tough lessons of the adventuring
      life.</p>

      <p>At the end of each session one of your Bonds may resolve.
      When a Bond is no longer applicable it can be resolved if the
      person you share that Bond with agrees. When a Bond is
      resolved you mark XP and write a new bond.</p>

      <p>You also look back at your alignment over the session you
      just concluded. If you fulfilled your alignment at least once
      in the session you'll get XP.</p>

      <p>The End of Session move also has three questions that all
      the players answer as a group. For each "yes" answer everyone
      gains XP.</p>

      <h2>Sessions</h2>

      <p class="NoIndent">A session of Dungeon World is one time
      you sit down to play. A session usually runs a few hours and
      may be a single adventure or part of a larger campaign.</p>

      <p>The first session of a game starts off a little different.
      First you'll need to choose a GM. Once the GM is settled,
      everyone else will need to make characters. See the character
      creation chapter for more on that.</p>

      <p>During character creation, the GM will be asking questions
      and making plans for how to start the game. A game of Dungeon
      World always starts with action, either action already
      underway or impending.</p>

      <p>Such a situation will lead to the characters making moves,
      which will cause further moves. Moves lead to more moves.
      This snowballing action from move to move is what builds an
      exciting game. Once a few moves have been made, you'll find
      it easy to keep going. The moves will keep giving you ideas
      and prompts for further action which leads to more moves.</p>

      <h2>Why?</h2>

      <p class="NoIndent">Why play Dungeon World?</p>

      <p>First, to see the characters do <strong>amazing
      things</strong>. To see them explore the unexplored, slay the
      undying, and go from the deepest bowels of the world to the
      highest peaks of the heavens. To see them caught up in
      momentous events and grand tragedies.</p>

      <p>Second, to see them <strong>play off each other</strong>:
      to stand together as a united front against their foes or to
      bicker and argue over treasure. To unite and fall apart and
      reunite again.</p>

      <p>Third, because <strong>the world still has so many places
      to explore</strong>. There are unlooted tombs and dragon
      hordes dotting the countryside just waiting for
      quick-fingered and strong-armed adventurers to discover them.
      That unexplored world has plans of its own. We play to see
      what they are and how they'll change the lives of our
      characters.</p>
    </div>

    <div xmlns:aid="http://ns.adobe.com/AdobeInDesign/4.0/">
      <h1>Character Creation</h1>

      <div>
        <p class="NoIndent">Making Dungeon World characters is
        quick and easy. You should all create your first characters
        together at the beginning of your first session. Character
        creation is, just like play, a kind of
        conversation&mdash;everyone should be there for it. It's
        somewhat likely your character may die along the way. if
        they do, no worries, the character creation process helps
        you make a new character that fits into the group in just a
        few minutes.</p>

        <p>If you're the GM, your role during character creation is
        to help everyone, ask questions, and take notes. When a
        player makes a choice&mdash;particularly for their
        Bonds&mdash;ask them about it. Get more detail. Think about
        what these details mean.</p>

        <p>The GM should also set expectations: the players are to
        play their characters as people. Skilled adventurers
        delving into dangerous places, but real people. The GM's
        role is to play the rest of the world as a dynamic,
        changing place.</p>

        <p>Some questions commonly come up during character
        creation:</p>

        <p><em>Are the characters friends?</em> No, not
        necessarily, but they do work together as a team for common
        goals. Their reasons for pursuing those goals may be
        different, but they generally manage to work together.</p>

        <p><em>Are there other Wizards?</em> Not really. There are
        other workers of arcane magic, and the common folk may call
        them wizards, but they're not like you. They don't have the
        same abilities, though they may be similar. Same goes for
        any class: there's only one Cleric, though there are many
        with similar powers of divine servitude. There's only one
        Thief, but there are others that fight from the shadows and
        steal things.</p>

        <p><em>What's coin?</em> Coin's the currency of the realm.
        It's good pretty much everywhere. It'll buy you mundane
        stuff, like steel swords and wooden staves, but the special
        stuff, like magic weapons, isn't for sale.</p>

        <p><em>Is the GM trying to kill us?</em> Nope. The GM
        represents the world. It's a dangerous place, and yeah, you
        might die. But she's not trying to kill you.</p>

        <p>Most everything you need to create a character you'll
        find on the character sheets. These steps will walk you
        through filling out a character sheet.</p>

        <h2>1. Choose a Class</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Look over the character classes and
        choose one that interests you. Everyone chooses a different
        class; there aren't two Wizards. If two people want the
        same class, talk it over like adults and compromise.</p>

        <p class="Example">I sit down with Paul and Shannon to play
        a game run by John. I've got some cool ideas for a Wizard,
        so I mention that would be my first choice. No one else was
        thinking of playing one, so I take the playbook.</p>

        <h2>2. Choose a Race</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Every class has a few race options.
        Choose one. Your race gives you a special move.</p>

        <p class="Example">I like the idea of summoning up Things
        From Beyond, so I choose Human, since that gives me a bonus
        to Summoning spells. I thought about being an Elf, but
        Shannon's playing the Cleric so I don't think we'll need
        more Cleric spells.</p>

        <h2>3. Choose a Name</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Choose your character&rsquo;s name from
        the list.</p>

        <p class="Example">Avon sounds good.</p>

        <h2>4. Choose Look</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Your look is your physical appearance.
        Choose one item from each list.</p>

        <p class="Example">Haunted eyes sound good, since I've seen
        Things From Beyond. No good Wizard has time for hair
        styling, wild hair it is. My robes are strange, and I
        mention to everyone that I think maybe they came from
        Beyond as part of one of my summonings. No time to eat with
        all that magic: thin body.</p>

        <h2>5. Choose Stats</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Look over the basic moves and the
        starting moves for your class. Pick out the move that
        interests you the most: something you'll be doing a lot, or
        something that you excel at. Put your 17 in the stat for
        that move. Look over the list again and pick out the next
        most important move to your character, maybe something that
        supports your first choice. Put your 15 in the stat for
        that move. Repeat this process for your remaining scores:
        13, 11, 9, 8.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, if everyone wants a little more
        randomness then you can roll stats. Roll 3d6 and assign the
        total to a stat&mdash;repeat this until you have all your
        stats.</p>

        <p>If you want something really random you can roll for
        stats in order (Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, Cha). If you
        choose this method you get to roll before you choose your
        class.</p>

        <p class="Example">It looks like I need Intelligence to
        cast spells, which are my thing, so my 17 goes there. The
        Defy Danger option for Dexterity looks like something I
        might be doing to dive out of the way of a spell, so that
        gets my 15. A 13 Wisdom will help me notice important
        details (and maybe keep my sanity, based on the Defy Danger
        move). Charisma might be useful is dealing with summoned
        creatures so I'll put my 11 there. Living is always nice,
        so I put my 9 in Constitution for some extra HP. Strength
        gets the 8.</p>

        <h2>6. Figure Out Modifiers</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Next you need to figure out the
        modifiers for your stats. The modifiers are what you use
        when a move says +Dex or +Cha. You won&rsquo;t actually use
        the raw scores much.</p>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Score</th>

            <th>Modifier</th>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>1&ndash;3</td>

            <td>-3</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>4&ndash;5</td>

            <td>-2</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>6&ndash;8</td>

            <td>-1</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>9&ndash;11</td>

            <td>0</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>12&ndash;15</td>

            <td>+1</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>16-17</td>

            <td>+2</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>18</td>

            <td>+3</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>7. Set Starting HP</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Your starting HP is equal to your
        class's base HP+Constitution score.</p>

        <p class="Example">Base 4 plus 9 con gives me a whopping 13
        HP. I guess Summoning takes a toll on the body.</p>

        <h2>8. Choose Starting Moves</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Some classes, like the Fighter, have
        choices to make as part of one of their moves. Make these
        choices now. The Wizard will need to choose spells for
        their spellbook. Both the Cleric and the Wizard will need
        to choose which spells they have prepared to start
        with.</p>

        <p class="Example">A Summoning spell is an easy choice, so
        I take Contact Spirits. Magic Missile will allow me to deal
        more damage than my pitiful d4 damage dice, so that's in
        too. I choose Alarm for my last spell, since I can think of
        some interesting uses for it.</p>

        <h2>9. Choose Alignment</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Your alignment is a few words that
        describe your character's moral outlook. These are general
        and tend to guide your character's outlook rather than
        dictate their actions. Usually alignment is a single term
        declaring the character's allegiance to the forces of good,
        the hordes of evil, or the path of neutrality between. The
        alignments are Good, Evil, and Neutral. Some classes may
        only be certain alignments. Choose your alignment&mdash;it
        gives you more ways to earn XP.</p>

        <p class="Example">Avon is all about the magical mysteries,
        which makes the Neutral alignment stand out. I'll go with
        that one.</p>

        <h2>10. Choose Gear</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Each class has choices to make for
        starting gear. Keep your Load in mind&mdash;it limits how
        much you can easily carry. Make sure to total up your armor
        and note it on your character sheet.</p>

        <p class="Example">I'm worried about my HP, so I take armor
        over books. A dagger sounds about right for rituals, I
        choose that over a staff. It's a toss up between the
        healing potion and the antitoxin, but healing wins out. I
        also end up with some rations.</p>

        <h2>11. Introduce Your Character</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Now that you know who your character
        is, it's time to introduce them to everyone else. Wait
        until everyone's finished choosing their name. Then go
        around the table; each player gets to share their look,
        class and anything else about their character. You can
        share your alignment now or keep it a secret if you
        prefer.</p>

        <p>This is also the time for the GM to ask questions. The
        GM's questions should help establish the relationships
        between characters ("What do you think about that?") and
        draw the group into the adventure ("Does that mean you've
        met Grundloch before?"). The GM should listen to everything
        in the description and ask about anything that stands out.
        Establish where they're from, who they are, how they came
        together, or anything else that seems relevant or
        interesting.</p>

        <p class="Example">"This is Avon, summoner of Things From
        Beyond! He's a human wizard with haunted eyes, wild hair,
        strange robes, and a thin body. Like I mentioned before his
        robes are strange because they're literally not of this
        world: they came through as part of a summoning
        ritual."</p>

        <h2>12. Choose Bonds</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Once everyone has described their
        characters you can choose your Bonds. You must fill in one
        bond but it's in your best interest to fill in more. For
        each blank fill in the name of one character. You can use
        the same character for more than one statement.</p>

        <p>Once everyone&rsquo;s filled in their bonds read them
        out to the group. When a move has you roll+bonds you'll
        count the number of Bonds you have with the character in
        question and add that to the roll.</p>

        <p class="Example">With everyone introduced I choose which
        character to list in each Bond, I have Paul's Fighter
        Gregor and Shannon's Cleric Brinton to choose from. The
        Bond about prophecy sounds fun, so I choose Gregor for it
        and end up with "Gregor will play an important role in the
        events to come. I have foreseen it!" It seems like The
        Wizard who contacts Things From Beyond and the Cleric might
        not see eye to eye, so I add Shannon's character and get
        "Brinton is woefully misinformed about the world; I will
        teach them all that I can." I leave my last Bond blank,
        I'll deal with it later. Once everyone is done I read my
        Bonds aloud and we all discuss what this means about why
        we're together and where we're going.</p>

        Leverage is something they need or want. On a hit they ask

        catch a glimpse of what lies beyond the Black Gates of
        Death's Kingdom (the GM will describe it), then roll (just
        roll, +nothing&mdash;yeah, Death doesn't care how tough or
        cool you are). On a 10+ you're stable. On a 7&ndash;9 Death
        will offer you a bargain&mdash;take it and stabilize or
        refuse and pass beyond the Black Gates into whatever fate
        awaits you. On a miss, you are dead.</p>

        <h2 class="BasicMoveName">Encumbrance</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">When you <strong>make a move while
        carrying weight</strong> up to or equal to Load, you're
        fine. When you make a move while carrying weight equal to
        load+1 or load+2, you take -1. When you make a move while
        carrying weight greater than load+2, you have a choice:
        drop at least 1 weight and roll at -1, or automatically
        fail.</p>

        <h2 class="BasicMoveName">Make Camp</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">When you <strong>settle in to
        rest</strong> consume a ration. If you're somewhere
        dangerous decide the watch order as well. If you have
        enough XP you may Level Up. When you wake from at least a
        few uninterrupted hours of sleep heal damage equal to half
        your max HP.</p>

        <h2 class="BasicMoveName">Take Watch</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">When you <strong>you're on watch and
        something approaches the camp</strong> roll+Wis. On a 10+
        you're able to wake the camp and prepare a response, the
        camp takes +1 forward. On a 7&ndash;9 you react just a
        moment too late; the camp is awake but hasn't had time to
        prepare. You have weapons and armor but little else. On a
        miss whatever lurks outside the campfire's light has the
        drop on you.</p>

        <h2 class="BasicMoveName">Undertake a Perilous Journey</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">When you travel through hostile
        territory, choose one member of the party to act as
        trailblazer, one to scout ahead, and one to be
        quartermaster (the same character cannot have two jobs). If
        you don't have enough party members or choose not to assign
        a job, treat that job as if it had rolled a 6. Each
        character with a job to do rolls+Wis. On a 10+ the
        quartermaster reduces the number of rations required by
        one. On a 10+ the trailblazer reduces the amount of time it
        takes to reach your destination (the GM will say by how
        much). On a 10+ the scout will spot any trouble quick
        enough to let you get the drop on it. On a 7&ndash;9 each
        roles performs their job as expected: the normal number of
        rations are consumed, the journey takes about as long as
        expected, no one gets the drop on you but you don't get the
        drop on them either.</p>

        <h2 class="BasicMoveName">Level Up</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">When you <strong>have downtime (hours
        or days) and XP equal to (or greater than) your current
        level + 7</strong>, subtract your current level +7 from
        your XP, increase your level by 1, and choose a new
        advanced move from your class. If you are the Wizard, you
        also get to add a new spell to your spellbook.</p>

        <p>If your new level is 3, 6, or 9, you also get to
        increase a stat by 2. Increase the base score of the stat
        of your choice by 2, adjust the modifier to reflect the new
        score. Changing your Constitution increases your maximum
        and current HP. Ability scores can't go higher than 18.</p>

        <h2 class="BasicMoveName">End of Session</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">When you <strong>reach the end of a
        session</strong>, choose one your bonds that you feel is
        resolved (completely explored, no longer relevant, or
        otherwise). Ask the player of the character you have the
        bond with if they agree. If they do, mark XP and write a
        new bond with whomever you wish.</p>

        <p>Once bonds have been updated look at your alignment. If
        you fulfilled that alignment at least once this session,
        mark XP. Then answer these three questions as a group:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Did we learn something new and important about the
          world?</li>

          <li>Did we overcome a notable monster or enemy?</li>

          <li>Did we loot a memorable treasure?</li>

        <h2 class="BasicMoveName">Carouse</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">When you <strong>return triumphant and
        throw a big party</strong>, spend 100 coin and roll + extra
        100s of coin spent. On a 10+ choose 3. On a 7&ndash;9
        choose 1. On a miss, you still choose one, but things get
        really out of hand.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>You befriend a useful NPC</li>

          <li>You hear rumors of an opportunity</li>

        <h2 class="BasicMoveName">Supply</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">When you <strong>go to buy something
        with gold on hand</strong>, if it's something readily
        available in the settlement you're in, you can buy it at
        market price. If it's something special, beyond what's
        usually available here, or non-mundane, roll+Cha. On a 10+
        you find what you're looking for at a fair price. On a
        7&ndash;9 you'll have to pay more or settle for something
        similar.</p>

        <h2 class="BasicMoveName">Recover</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">When you <strong>do nothing but rest in
        comfort and safety</strong> after a day of rest you recover
        all your HP. After three days of rest you remove one
        debility of your choice. If you're under the care of a
        healer (magical or otherwise) you heal a debility for every
        two days of rest instead.</p>

        <h2 class="BasicMoveName">Recruit</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">When you <strong>put out word that

        known&hellip;</p>

        <ul>
          <li>&hellip;that your pay is generous, take +1</li>

          <li>&hellip;what you're setting out to do, take +1</li>

          <li>&hellip;that they'll get a share of whatever you
          find, take +1</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="NoIndent">If you have a useful reputation around
        these parts take an additional +1. On a 10+ you've got your
        pick of a number of skilled applicants, your choice who you
        hire, no penalty for not taking them along. On a 7&ndash;9
        you'll have to settle for someone close or turn them away.
        On a miss someone influential and ill-suited declares
        they'd like to come along (a foolhardy youth, a
        loose-cannon, or a veiled enemy, for example), bring them
        and take the consequences or turn them away. If you turn
        away applicants you take -1 forward to Recruit.</p>

        <h2 class="BasicMoveName">Outstanding Warrants</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">When you <strong>return to a civilized
        place in which you've caused trouble before</strong>,
        roll+Cha. On a hit, word has spread of your deeds and
        everyone recognizes you. On a 7&ndash;9, that, and, the GM
        chooses a complication:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The local constabulary has a warrant out for your
          arrest</li>

          <li>Someone has put a price on your head</li>

          <li>Someone important to you has been put in a bad spot

        preparation. If you prepare for a month or longer, 3
        preparation. When your preparation pays off spend 1

        Items carried by an unseen servant appear to float in the

        it, flavor it, or change its color. If you cast the spell
        without touching an item you can instead create minor
        illusions no bigger than yourself. Prestidigitation

      <h1>Equipment</h1>

      <div>
        <p class="NoIndent">The musty tombs and forgotten treasure
        troves of the world are filled with useful items. The
        Fighters can find a sharp new sword or the Thief might
        stumble across a deadly poison. Most items are mundane; not
        magical or intrinsically unique in any way. Any item that
        is magical or one-of-a-kind is not mundane for the purposes
        of moves. The Fighter's signature weapon is never
        mundane.</p>

        <p>Weapons don't kill monsters, people do. That's why
        weapons don't have damage listed. A weapon is useful
        primarily for its tags which describe what the weapon is
        useful for. A dagger is not useful because it does more or
        less damage than some other blade. It's useful because its
        small and easy to strike with at close distance. A dagger
        in the hands of a Wizard is not nearly so dangerous as one
        in the hands of a skilled Fighter.</p>

        <p>The stats below are for typical items. There are, of
        course, variations. A dull long sword might be -1 damage
        instead while a masterwork dagger could be +1 damage.
        Consider the following to be stats for a typical weapon of
        that type&mdash;a specific weapon could have different tags
        to represent its features.</p>

        <h2>Tag Glossary</h2>

        <p><em>n Ammo</em>: It counts as n ammo for appropriate
        ranged weapons.</p>

        <p><em>Applied</em>: It's only useful when carefully
        applied to a person or something they eat or drink.</p>

        <p><em>n Armor</em>: It protects you from harm and absorbs
        damage. When you take damage, subtract your armor from the
        total. If you have more than one item with n-armor, only
        the highest value counts.</p>

        <p><em>+n Armor</em>: It protects you and stacks with other
        armor. Add its value to your total armor.</p>

        <p><em>Awkward</em>: It's unwieldy and tough to use.</p>

        <p><em>+Bonus</em>: It modifies your effectiveness in some
        particular situation. It might be "+1 forward to Spout
        Lore" or "-1 ongoing to Hack and Slash."</p>

        <p><em>Clumsy</em>: It's tough to move around with. -1
        ongoing while using it.</p>

        <p><em>n coins</em>: How much it costs to buy, normally. If
        the cost includes "-Charisma" a little negotiation
        subtracts the haggler's Charisma score (not modifier) from
        the price.</p>

        <p><em>+n Damage</em>: It is particularly harmful to your
        enemies. When you deal damage, you add n to it.</p>

        <p><em>Dangerous</em>: It's easy to get in trouble with it.
        If you interact with it without proper precautions the GM
        may freely invoke the consequences of your foolish
        actions.</p>

        <p><em>Forceful</em>: It can knock someone back a pace,
        maybe even off their feet.</p>

        <p><em>Ignores Armor</em>: Don't subtract armor from the
        damage taken.</p>

        <p><em>Messy</em>: It does damage in a particularly
        destructive way, ripping people and things apart.</p>

        <p><em>n Piercing</em>: It goes right through armor. When
        you deal damage with n piercing, you subtract n from the
        enemy's armor for that attack.</p>

        <p><em>Precise</em>: It rewards careful strikes. You use
        Dex to Hack and Slash with this weapon, not Str.</p>

        <p><em>Ration</em>: It's edible, more or less.</p>

        <p><em>Reload</em>: After you attack with it, it takes more
        than a moment to reset for another attack.</p>

        <p><em>Requires</em>: It's only useful to certain people.
        If you don't meet the requirements it works weakly, if at
        all.</p>

        <p><em>Slow</em>: It takes minutes or more to use.</p>

        <p><em>Thrown</em>: Throw it at someone to hurt them. If
        you Volley with this weapon, you can't choose to mark off
        ammo on a 7&ndash;9. Once you throw it, it's lost until you
        can recover it.</p>

        <p><em>Touch</em>: It's used by touching it to the target's
        skin.</p>

        <p><em>Two-handed</em>: It takes two hands to use it
        effectively.</p>

        <p><em>Stun</em>: When you attack with it, it does stun
        damage instead of normal damage.</p>

        <p><em>n Uses</em>: It can only be used n times.</p>

        <p><em>n Weight</em>: Count the listed amount against your
        Load. Something with no listed weight isn't designed to be
        carried. 100 coins in standard denominations is 1 weight.
        The same value in gems or fine art may be lighter or
        heavier.</p>

        <p><em>Worn</em>: To use it, you have to be wearing it.</p>

        <h3>Range Tags (From Closest to Furthest)</h3>

        <p><em>Hand</em>: It's useful for attacking something
        within your reach, no further.</p>

        <p><em>Close</em>: It's useful for attacking something at
        arm's reach plus a foot or two.</p>

        <p><em>Reach</em>: It's useful for attacking something
        that's several feet away&mdash;maybe as far as ten.</p>

        <p><em>Near</em>: It's useful for attacking if you can see
        the whites of their eyes.</p>

        <p><em>Far</em>: It's useful for attacking something in
        shouting distance.</p>

        <h1>Magic Items</h1>

        <p class="NoIndent">There are stranger things in the world
        than swords and leather. Magic items are the non-mundane,
        items that have intrinsic power.</p>

        <p>Magic items are for you to make for your game. Players
        can make magic items through the Wizard's ritual and
        similar moves. The GM can introduce magic items in the
        spoils of battle or the bounty of reward. This list
        provides some ideas, but magic items are ultimately for you
        to decide.</p>

        <p>When making your own magic items keep in mind that magic
        items are magical. +1 damage is the realm of the mundane,
        magic items should provide more interesting bonuses.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Argo-Thaan, Holy Avenger <span
        class="Tags">Close, 2 Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">There are many swords in this world,
        but there is only one Argo-thaan. It is a blade of gold,
        silver and light, revered as a holy relic by all orders and
        religions for whom Good rings true. Its touch is a blessing
        and to many, the sight of it brings tears of joy.</p>

        <p>In the hands of a Paladin, it strikes true and strong;
        his damage die becomes 1d12 and he has access to every
        Paladin move. As well, Argo-thaan can harm any creature of
        Evil, regardless of any defenses it may have. No Evil
        creature may touch it without suffering agony. In the hands
        of any non-Paladin, it is merely a sword, heavier and more
        cumbersome than most.</p>

        <p>Argo-thaan, while not intelligent, will forever be drawn
        to a cause of True Good, like iron to a magnet.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Arrows of Acheron <span class="Tags">1
        Ammo, 1 Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">Crafted in darkness by a blind
        fletcher, these arrows can find their target in even the
        deepest darkness. An archer may fire them blind, in the
        dark, with his eyes bound by heavy cloth and still be
        assured of a clean shot. If the light of the sun ever
        touches the arrows, however, they come apart like shadows
        and dust.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Axe of the Conqueror-King <span
        class="Tags">Close, 1 Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">It is crafted of shining steel, glowing
        with a golden light and imbued with mythical powers of
        authority. The bearer of the Axe becomes a beacon of
        inspiration to all she leads. Any Henchmen in her employ
        have +1 Loyalty, no matter whether she is a benevolent
        Princess or wicked Queen.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Barb of the Black Gate <span
        class="Tags">0 Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">A nail or spike, twisted and forever
        cold, said to have been pried from the Gates of Death
        himself. When hammered into a corpse, it disappears and
        ensures that corpse will never be risen again&mdash;no
        magic short of that of Death himself can reignite the flame
        of life (natural or otherwise) in the body.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Bag of Holding <span class="Tags">0
        Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">A bag of holding is larger on the
        inside than the outside, it can contain an infinite number
        of items, and its weight never increases. When you try to
        retrieve an item from a bag of holding, roll+Wis. On a 10+,
        it's right there. On a 7-9, choose one:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>You get the exact item, but it takes a while</li>

          <li>You get a similar item of the GM's choice, but it
          only takes a moment</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="NoIndent">No matter how many items it contains, a
        bag of holding is always 0 weight.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">The Burning Wheel <span class="Tags">2
        Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">An ancient wooden wheel, as might
        appear on a war-wagon, banded with steel. On a glance, it
        appears to be nothing special&mdash;many spokes are
        shattered and the thing seems mundane. Under the scrutiny
        of magic or the eyes of an expert, its true nature is
        revealed; the Burning Wheel is a gift from the God of Fire
        and burns with his authority.</p>

        <p>When you hold The Burning Wheel and speak a god's name,
        roll+Con. On a 7+, the god you name takes notice and grants
        you an audience. An audience with a god is not without a
        price: on a 10+, you choose one of your stats and reduce it
        to the next lowest modifier (for example, a 14 is +1, so it
        would be reduced to 11, a +0). On a 7&ndash;9, the GM
        chooses which stat to reduce.</p>

        <p>Once used, the Burning Wheel ignites and burns with
        brilliant light. It does not confer any protection from
        those flames, nor does it provide any bonus to
        swimming.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Captain Bligh's Cornucopia <span
        class="Tags">1 Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">A brass naval horn, curled and ornate,
        carved with symbols of the gods of Plenty. Sounded, the
        horn spills forth not sound but food. Enough to feed a meal
        to everyone who hears its sound.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">The Carcosan Spire <span
        class="Tags">Reach, Thrown, 3 Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">None know from whence this spear of
        twisted white coral comes. Those who bear it too long find
        their minds full of alien dreams and begin to hear the
        strange thoughts of the Others. None are impervious. Used
        against any &ldquo;natural&rdquo; target (men, goblins,
        owlbears and the like) the Spire acts as a mere mortal
        spear. Its true purpose is to do harm to those things whose
        strange natures protect them against mundane weapons. Used
        thus, the Spire can wound foes otherwise invulnerable to
        harm. The wielder will recognize these twisted foes on
        sight&mdash;the Spire knows its own.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Cloak of Silent Stars <span
        class="Tags">1 Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">A cape of rich black velvet outside and
        sparkling with tiny points of light within, the Cloak bends
        fate, time and reality around it to protect the wearer, who
        may Defy Danger with whatever stat he likes. To do this,
        the wearer invokes the cloak&rsquo;s magic and his player
        describes how the cloak helps him "break the rules." He can
        deflect a fireball with his Cha by convincing it he
        deserves to live or elude a fall by applying the mighty
        logic of his Int to prove the fall won&rsquo;t hurt him.
        The Cloak makes it so. It can be used once for each stat
        before losing its magic.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Coin of Remembering <span
        class="Tags">0 Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">What appears, at a glance, to be a
        simple copper coin is, in truth, an enchanted coin. Its
        bearer can, at any time, redeem it to know immediately one
        fact that has been forgotten. The coin vanishes thereafter.
        It does not have to be a thing forgotten by the bearer, but
        it cannot be &ldquo;known&rdquo;. Interpretation of this
        stipulation is left to the Gods. If the coin is
        unsuccessful, it will still paint an image in the minds eye
        of someone or something that does remember what was
        sought.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Common Scroll <span class="Tags">1
        Use, 0 Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">A common scroll has a spell inscribed
        on it. The spell must be castable by you or on your class's
        spell list for you to be able to cast it. When you cast a
        spell from a scroll, the spell has effect, simple as
        that.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Devilsbane Oil <span class="Tags">1
        Use, 0 Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">A holy oil, created in limited supply
        by a mute sect of mountain-monks whose order protected
        humanity from the powers of the Demon Pits in ancient
        epochs. Only a few jars remain. When applied to any weapon
        and used to strike a denizen of any outer plane, the oil
        undoes the magic that binds that creature. In some cases,
        this will return it to its home. In others, it merely
        undoes any magic controlling it. The oil stays on the
        weapon for a few hours before it dries and flakes away.</p>

        <p>If applied to the edges of a doorway or drawn in a
        circle, the oil will repel creatures whose home is any of
        the outer planes. They cannot pass across it. The oil lasts
        for one full day before it soaks in or evaporates.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Earworm Wax <span class="Tags">1 Use,
        0 Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">A yellowish candle. Seems never to burn
        out and the light it casts is strange and weak. Its wax is
        always cool, too. Drip the wax into the ear of a target and
        gain 3 hold. Spend that hold and ask your target a
        question. They find themselves telling you the whole truth,
        despite themselves. The consequences, after the fact? Those
        are up to you to deal with.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">The Echo <span class="Tags">0
        Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">A seemingly empty bottle. Once
        unstoppered, the whispers of another plane resound once and
        fall silent. In the silence, the bearer learns in his soul
        the coming of one great danger and how he can avoid it. At
        any point after the Echo is used, the wielder can ignore
        the results of any single die roll&mdash;hers or another
        player&mdash;and roll again. Once opened, the Echo is
        released and gone forever.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">The Epoch Lens <span class="Tags">1
        Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">An archmage, old and too frail to leave
        his tower, crafted this intricate and fragile device of
        glass and gold to examine the histories and relics he so
        loved. Looking at an object through the lens reveals
        visions of who made it and where it came from.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Farsight Stone <span class="Tags">1
        Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">Swirling clouds fill this smoky orb and
        those in its presence often hear strange whispers. In
        ancient times, it was part of a network of such stones,
        used to communicate and surveil across great distances.
        When you gaze into the stone, name a location and roll+Wis.
        On a hit, you see a clear vision of the location and can
        maintain it as long as you concentrate on the orb. On a
        7&ndash;9, you draw the attention of some other thing (an
        angel, a demon, or the holder of another Farsight stone)
        that uses the stone to surveil you, as well.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">The Fiasco Codex <span class="Tags">0
        Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">A thick tome, said to be penned in the
        blood of poor fools and robber-barons by some demon prince
        possessed of dark humor, the Codex details tales and
        stories of those whose ambition overwhelmed their reason.
        Reading from this tome teaches one the value of
        clear-headedness but leaves a sense of dread behind. When
        you read from the Codex, Roll+Wis. On a 10+, ask two. On a
        7&ndash;9, just one.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>What is my greatest opportunity, right now?</li>

          <li>Who can I betray to gain an advantage?</li>

          <li>Who is an ally I should not trust?</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="NoIndent">The Codex gives up its answers only
        once to each reader and takes 2 to 3 hours to read.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Flask of Breath <span class="Tags">0
        Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">A simple thing, but useful when you
        need a breath of fresh air. The flask appears empty but
        cannot be filled, anything added to it simply spills out.
        This is because the flask is eternally full of air. If
        placed underwater, it will bubble forever. If pressed to
        the mouth, one can breath normally&mdash;smoke is no
        concern, for example. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll find all
        sorts of unusual uses for it.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Folly Held Aloft, The Wax Wings, A
        Huge Mistake <span class="Tags">1 Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">Who hasn&rsquo;t always wanted to soar
        the pretty blue sky? In an attempt to grant the wishes of
        land-bound folk, these great magical wings were created.
        Known by many names and crafted by as many mages, they
        commonly take the shape of the wings of whatever local
        birds hold affection. Worn by means of a harness or, in
        some dire cases, a surgical procedure.</p>

        <p>When you take to the air with these magical wings,
        roll+Dex. On a 10+ your flight is controlled and you may
        stay aloft as long as you like. On a 7&ndash;9, you make it
        aloft but your flight is short or erratic and
        unpredictable, your choice. On a 6- you make it aloft, but
        the coming-down part and everything between is up to the
        GM.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Immovable Rod <span class="Tags">0
        Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">A funny metal rod with a button on it.
        Press the button and the rod just sticks. It freezes in
        place&mdash;in mid air, standing up or lying down. It
        can&rsquo;t be moved. Pull it, push it, try as hard as you
        like, the rod stays. Maybe it can be destroyed, maybe it
        can&rsquo;t. Push the button again and it&rsquo;s
        free&mdash;take it along with you. Might be useful to have
        such a stubborn thing along.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Infinite Book <span class="Tags">1
        Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">This book contains an infinite number
        of pages in a finite space. With no limit to the pages,
        everything that ever was, is, or will be is contained
        somewhere in the book. Luckily the index is great.</p>

        <p>When you Spout Lore while consulting the book you gain
        an extra clause. On a 12+ the GM will give a solution to a
        problem or situation you're in.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Inspectacles <span class="Tags">0
        Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">Rough-hewn glass in wooden frames.
        Dinged up and barely held together, they somehow allow the
        wearer to see much more than their mere eyes might. When
        you Discern Realities wearing these gifted lenses, you get
        to bend the rules a little. On a roll of 10+, ask any three
        questions you like. They don&rsquo;t have to be on the
        list. As long as sight could give you answers, the GM will
        tell you what you want to know.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">The Ku&rsquo;meh Maneuver and Other
        Stratagem <span class="Tags">1 Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">A great leathery tome worn shiny by the
        hands of a hundred great generals, this book is often
        passed from warrior to warrior, from son to father along
        the great battle lines that have divided Dungeon
        World&rsquo;s past. Anyone reading it may, upon finishing
        for the first time, roll+Int. On a 10+ hold 3, on a
        7&ndash;9 hold 1. You may spend your hold to advise a
        companion on some matter of strategic or tactical
        significance. This advice allows you to, at any time,
        regardless of distance, roll to Aid them on any one roll.
        On a miss, the GM can hold 1 and spend it to apply -2 to
        any roll of yours or the poor sap who listened to your
        advice.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Lamented Memento <span class="Tags">0
        Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">Taking the form of a single lock of
        bright red hair, bound in a black ribbon and immune to the
        ravages of time, the Lamented Memento bears a grim
        enchantment. In it are the memories and emotions of a girl
        who dealt with Death at the Black Gates so many times that,
        in the end, they fell in love and she left the world to be
        with him for a time. Her memory protects the wielder. If he
        finds himself at the Gates, the Memento can be traded for
        an automatic result of 10+ on the Last Breath move.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Lodestone Shield <span class="Tags">+1
        armor, 1 Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">What mixed-up dummy made this? Shields
        are meant to repel metal, not draw it in! Emblazoned with a
        lion rampant, the Lodestone Shield has the power to pull
        blades and arrows to it. When you Defend against enemies
        using metal weapons you can spend one hold, per target, to
        disarm them. Also, sometimes you&rsquo;ll find a handful of
        loose change stuck to it.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Map of the Last Patrol <span
        class="Tags">0 Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">An ancient order of brave rangers once
        patrolled the land, protecting villages and warning kings
        and queens of encroaching danger. They&rsquo;re long gone,
        now, but their legacy remains. This map, when marked with
        the blood of a group of people, will always show their
        location&mdash;so long as they remain within the bounds of
        the map.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Ned's Head <span class="Tags">1
        Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">An old skull, missing its jaw and very
        much worse-for-wear. The skull remembers the folly of its
        former owner&mdash;a man with more honor than sense. Once
        per night, the owner of the skull can ask &ldquo;Who has it
        in for me?&rdquo; and the skull will give up one name in a
        sad, lonely voice. If the owner of the skull is ever
        killed, it disappears surreptitiously. No-one knows where
        it might turn up next.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Nightsider's Key <span class="Tags">0
        Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">This key unlocks any door, provided the
        owner of the key does not belong where she intends to go.
        So long as the intruder does nothing that would alert
        another to her presence (remaining unheard, unseen and
        unnoticed) and takes nothing more than her memories out
        with her, the key&rsquo;s magic will prevent her intrusion
        from ever being discovered. It&rsquo;s like she was never
        there at all.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Sacred Herbs <span class="Tags">0
        Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">The sacred herbs, collected and
        prepared by an order of lost wizard-monks, can be found in
        bundles with two or three uses to them. Kept dry, they last
        indefinitely. When smoked in a pipe or consumed in an
        incense burner and the thick, blue smoke inhaled, these
        herbs will grant strange visions of far away places and
        distant times. If the imbiber focuses his will on a
        particular person, place or thing, the herbs will respond:
        roll+Wis. On a 10+ the vision is clear and
        useful&mdash;some valid information is gained. On a
        7&ndash;9 the vision is of the focus, but unclear, fraught
        with metaphor or somehow difficult to understand. On a
        miss, the GM will ask you &ldquo;What is it you fear
        most?&rdquo; You must answer honestly, of course.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">The Sartar Duck <span class="Tags">0
        Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">An odd, hand-carved wooden duck. Who
        would make such a funny thing? Whoever bears it finds
        himself an exceptionally gifted storyteller&mdash;no matter
        the language, he can make himself and his story clear to
        any audience. They will understand his meaning, if not his
        words.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Tears of Annalise <span class="Tags">0
        Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">Cloudy red gemstones the size of a
        thumbnail, the Tears of Annalise are always found in pairs.
        When swallowed, they bind the swallowers
        together&mdash;when either feels strong emotions
        (particularly sadness, loss, fear or desire) the other
        feels it, as well. The effects last until one spills the
        blood of the other.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Teleportation Room <span
        class="Tags">Slow</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">James Ninefingers, eccentric genius
        mage, created these room-sized magical apparati. A stone
        room etched with runes and scribblings, glowing with a
        faint blue light. When you enter and say aloud the name of
        a location, roll+Int. On a 10+, you arrive exactly where
        you&rsquo;d intended. On a 7&ndash;9, the GM chooses a safe
        location nearby. On a miss, you end up someplace. Maybe
        it&rsquo;s nearby? It&rsquo;s definitely not safe. Strange
        things sometimes happen to those who bend time and space
        with these devices.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Timunn's Armor <span class="Tags">1
        Armor, 1 Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">A stealthy suit of armor, it appears as
        many things to many people and blends in with appropriate
        apparel. The wearer always seems the height of fashion to
        any who gaze upon him.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Titus&rsquo; Truthful Tallow <span
        class="Tags">0 Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">A candle of ivory-and-copper colored
        tallow with a wick of spun silver. When lit, none upon whom
        its light falls is able to tell a lie. They may keep silent
        or dissemble but when asked a question directly, they can
        speak naught but truth.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Tricksy Rope <span class="Tags">1
        Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">A rope that listens. Does tricks, too,
        like a smart and more obedient snake might. Tell it
        &ldquo;coil&rdquo; or &ldquo;slack&rdquo; or &ldquo;come
        here, rope&rdquo; and it will.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">The Sterling Hand <span class="Tags">0
        Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">Crafted by dwarven whitesmiths, this
        mirrored-metal hand is deeply scored with runes of power
        and rejuvenation. Meant to replace wounded or destroyed
        limbs from mining accidents, the Sterling Hand bonds to the
        wound, old or new, and is strong and stout. It can be used
        as a weapon (near range) and is made of pure enough silver
        to harm creatures affected by such.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Vellius&rsquo;s Gauntlets <span
        class="Tags">1 Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">Crafted in the name of Vellius the
        Clumsy, Vellius the Butter-Fingered, Vellius the Clod,
        these gloves of simple cloth prevent the wearer from
        dropping any object she does not intent to. She cannot be
        disarmed nor fall from any rope or ladder, for example.
        This item can get very messy if you have something strong
        pulling at your legs while you grip onto something
        solid.</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Violation Glaive <span
        class="Tags">Reach, 2 Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">A legendary blade, said to have been
        thrust backwards in time from some grim future, the
        violation glaive is crafted of strange green iron. The
        blade strikes at the mind of those it wounds, as well as
        the body. When you Hack &amp; Slash on a 10+ you have an
        additional option: you can deal your normal damage, let
        them counter attack you, and instill the emotion of your
        choice (maybe fear, reverence, or trust)</p>

        <p class="MagicItem">Vorpal Sword <span class="Tags">Close,
        3 Piercing, 2 Weight</span></p>

        <p class="NoIndent">Snicker-snack and all that. Sharp as
        anything, this simple-seeming sword means to separate one
        thing from another&mdash;the limb from the body or folk
        from their lives. When you deal damage with the Vorpal
        Sword, your enemy must choose something (an item, an
        advantage, a limb) and lose it, permanently.</p>

      <h1>The GM</h1>

      <div>
        <p class="NoIndent">This section is about the art and rules
        of being the Game Master or GM. There are many styles of
        GMing epic fantasy games with things like dragons and
        dungeons and brave adventurers but Dungeon World is
        designed for one of those styles in particular. These rules
        will help you run a game in that style.</p>

        <p>Just because the rules are mechanical doesn't mean
        they're removed from the fiction of what's actually
        happening in the game or that you're playing to win. You'll
        be refereeing, adjudicating, and narrating your part the
        game much like you would any other game. You'll just have a
        framework that helps you determine what to say, at what
        time.</p>

        <p>The GM's rules are rules, just like the rules for moves
        and character creation and all the rest. Just like every
        other rule in the game, they are designed to help you play
        a game of exploration and epic fantasy. You will of course
        be making your own rules, in the form of custom moves, but
        the GM's rules are as important to playing Dungeon World as
        the rules for rolling dice. Play with the rules as written
        before making any changes, and think carefully about any
        changes you do make.</p>

        <h3>The Basics</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">Dungeon World is built on a framework:
        the GM's <strong>agenda</strong>,
        <strong>principles</strong>, and <strong>moves</strong>.
        The GM's agenda is what they set out to do when they sit
        down at the table. The principles are the guides that keep
        the GM focused on their agenda. The GM's moves are the
        concrete, moment-to-moment things the GM does to drive the
        game forward. The GM's moves aren't like player moves, they
        aren't triggered by the fiction. Instead they are actions
        that drive the game onward.</p>

        <p>The GM's agenda, principles, and moves are rules just
        like damage or stats or HP. You should take the same care
        in altering them or ignoring them that you would with any
        other rule. Changing a principle may have just as much of
        an effect on your game as changing the Fighter's damage
        dice or giving the Cleric access to Wizard spells.</p>

        <h2>Always Say</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">When running Dungeon World as the GM
        you say these things:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>What the rules demand</li>

          <li>What the adventure demands</li>

          <li>What honesty demands</li>

          <li>What the principles demand</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="NoIndent">The players have it easy&mdash;they
        just say what their characters say, think and do. You have
        it a bit harder. You have to say everything else. So what
        do you say? Say <strong>what the rules tell you
        to</strong>. If a move has triggered, yours or the
        players', then say what the rules tell you to say.
        Embellish and expand but use the rules to give you a start.
        The rules will always give you material to work with.</p>

        <p>Say <strong>what the adventure demands</strong>. You'll
        know some things before you sit down at the table. You
        might know where the goblins are hiding or when the
        reinforcements are going to arrive. If the players haven't
        done anything to change those things, stick with them.</p>

        <p>Always <strong>be honest</strong>. If the rules tell you
        to give out information, like the Spout Lore and Discern
        Realities moves, do it. Don't lie or give half truths; be
        open and honest&mdash;generous, even. The player characters
        have risked something to get that information just by
        rolling so make it worth their while. If you don't know the
        answer make one up or turn the question back to the
        players. Once you tell the players it's set in stone, no
        going back on it.</p>

        <p>This applies in general to the players' actions, too. If
        they have worked to achieve something, you should give it
        to them fully. You're not here to fight back against the
        players; you're not opposed to them at all. You are playing
        the game with them.</p>

        <p>At all times, <strong>use your principles and
        agenda</strong> as a filter or inspiration. If something
        falls flat it's usually because you ignored one of your
        principles or acted on a different agenda. If you're unsure
        of what you're about to say just take a moment and look at
        your agenda and principles to make sure you're abiding by
        them.</p>

        <h2>Agenda</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">The GM's agenda is what they sit down
        at the table to do:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Make the world fantastic</li>

          <li>Fill the characters' lives with adventure</li>

          <li>Play to find out what happens</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="NoIndent">Everything you say, create, and do at
        the table and away from the table is to accomplish these
        three goals and no others. Things that aren't on this list
        aren't your goals. You're not trying to beat the players or
        test their ability to solve complex traps. You're not here
        to give the players a chance to explore your finely crafted
        setting. You're most certainly not here to tell everyone a
        planned story.</p>

        <p>That one deserves repeating: <strong>you are not here to
        tell everyone a planned story</strong>. Don't ever plan a
        storyline. You do not know what will happen to the players'
        characters any more than they do. Your job is to portray a
        fantastic world, not provide a canned plot.</p>

        <p>To that end, Dungeon World adventures
        <strong>never</strong> presume player actions. A Dungeon
        World adventure describes a location in motion, someplace
        important with creatures pursuing their own goals. As the
        players come into conflict with that location, it will
        snowball into action. You'll honestly portray the
        repercussions of their actions.</p>

        <p>When you play this way you get to share in the fun of
        finding out what happens to the characters and the world
        around them. You're not a frustrated novelist trying to
        organize your unruly characters. You're a participant in a
        great story that's unfolding. So really&mdash;don't plan
        the story. The rules of the game will fight you.</p>

        <p><strong>Fill the character's life with
        adventure</strong> means helping the players create a world
        that's exciting and full of epic foes to battle, strange
        places to explore, and glorious treasure to discover.
        Adventurers are always caught up in some plot or
        world-threatening danger or another&mdash;encourage and
        foster that kind of action in the game.</p>

        <p>The players have an agenda too, but it's probably
        something they'll do by default: portray their
        characters.</p>

        <h2>Principles</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Draw maps, leave blanks</li>

          <li>Address the characters, not the players</li>

          <li>Embrace the fantastic</li>

          <li>Make a move that follows</li>

          <li>Never speak the name of your move</li>

          <li>Give every monster life</li>

          <li>Name every person</li>

          <li>Ask questions and use the answers</li>

          <li>Be a fan of the characters</li>

          <li>Think Dangerous</li>

          <li>Begin and end with the fiction</li>

          <li>Think offscreen, too</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="NoIndent">Your principles are your guides. Often,
        when it's time to make a move, you'll already have an idea.
        Quickly run it past your principles and make sure it fits,
        then go with it.</p>

        <h4>Draw maps, leave blanks</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">Dungeon World is mostly in our
        imaginations, but we can actually see it when we draw a
        map. So, make use of maps. You won't always be drawing them
        yourself, but any time there's a new location draw it on a
        map (or make a new map for it).</p>

        <p>When you draw a map, it doesn't have to be complete.
        Leave blanks, places that are unknown to you. As you play
        you'll get more ideas or the players will give you
        inspiration to work with.</p>

        <h4>Address the characters, not the players</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">Addressing the characters, not the
        players, means that you don't say "Whit, is Dunwick doing
        something about that wight?" Instead you say "Dunwick, what
        are you doing about the wight?" Talking this way keeps the
        game rooted in the fiction and not at the table. It's
        important to the flow of the game, too. If you talk to the
        players you may leave out details that are important to
        what moves the characters make. Since moves are always
        based on the actions of the character you need to think
        about what's happening in terms of characters&mdash;not
        players.</p>

        <h4>Embrace the fantastic</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">The fantastic is the core of fantasy:
        magic, strange vistas, gods, demons, and abominations. The
        player characters already have these kind of abilities, so
        you should reflect them in the world.</p>

        <h4>Make a move that follows</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">When you make a move what you're
        actually doing is taking some element of the fiction and
        bringing it to bear against the characters. Your move
        should always follow from the fiction, and you never speak
        its name. Instead describe the fictional actions that take
        place which follow from the situation established.</p>

        <h4>Never speak the name of your move</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">There is no quicker way to ruin the
        consistency of Dungeon World than to tell the players what
        move you're making. Your moves are prompts to you, not
        things you say directly.</p>

        <p>You never show the players that you're picking a move
        from a list. You know the reason the slavers dragged off
        Omar was because you made the "Put someone in a spot" move,
        but you show it to the players as a straightforward outcome
        of their actions.</p>

        <h4>Give every monster life</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">Monsters are nameless hordes of
        creatures that stand between the players and what they
        want. Give each monster details that bring it to life:
        smells, sights, sounds. Your monsters are arrows, fired en
        masse at the players. Give each enough detail to make it
        real, but don't cry when it gets slain by intrepid
        adventurers.</p>

        <h4>Name every person</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">Every person gets a name. You'll have a
        name list to work from on your adventure sheet, so don't
        worry too much about it. Anyone that the players interact
        with has a name. They probably have a personality and some
        goals or opinions too, but you can figure that out as you
        go. Start with a name. The rest can flow from there.</p>

        <p>How do you know if someone gets a name? If you start
        dealing with them as an individual (not just "a member of
        the Knob Street gang" or "a goblin ambusher") it's time for
        a name.</p>

        <h4>Ask questions and use the answers</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">You don't have to know everything. If
        you don't know, or you don't have an idea, just ask the
        players and use what they say.</p>

        <p>The easiest question to use is "What do you do?"
        Whenever you make a move, end with "What do you do?" You
        don't even have to ask the person you made the move
        against. Take that chance to shift the focus elsewhere:
        "Rath's spell is torn apart with a flick of the mage's
        wand. Finnegan, that spell was aiding you. What are you
        doing now that it's gone?"</p>

        <h4>Be a fan of the characters</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">Treat the players' characters like
        characters you watch on TV. You want to see how things turn
        out for them. You're not here to make them lose, or to make
        them win, and definitely not to guide them to your story.
        You're here to portray the interesting world around them
        and see how interacting with that world changes
        everything.</p>

        <h4>Think Dangerous</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">Thinking Dangerous means that
        everything in the world is a target. You're thinking like
        an evil overlord: no single life is worth anything, there
        is nothing sacrosanct. Everything can be put in danger,
        everything can be destroyed. Nothing you create is ever
        protected. Whenever your eye falls on something you've
        created, think dangerous. Think how it can be put in
        danger, fall apart, crumble.</p>

        <h4>Begin and end with the fiction</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">Everything you and the players do in
        Dungeon World comes from and leads to fictional events.
        When the players make a move, they always take a fictional
        action to trigger it, apply the rules, and get a fictional
        effect. When you make a move it always comes from the
        fiction.</p>

        <p>You can apply this to everything you say. Start with the
        fiction ("The ogre's axe comes sailing down into your
        shoulder&hellip;"), apply the rules ("&hellip;you take 12
        damage&hellip;"), go back to the fiction ("&hellip;as your
        collar bone cracks beneath your armor. What do you
        do?").</p>

        <h4>Think offscreen too</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">Just because you're a fan of the
        characters doesn't mean everything happens right in front
        of them. Sometimes your best move is in the next room, or
        another part of the dungeon, or even back in town. Make
        your move elsewhere and show the effects later.</p>

        <h2>Moves</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Use a monster, danger, or location move</li>

          <li>Reveal an unwelcome truth</li>

          <li>Show signs of doom</li>

          <li>Deal damage</li>

          <li>Use up their resources</li>

          <li>Turn their move back on them</li>

          <li>Separate them</li>

          <li>Give an opportunity that fits a class' abilities</li>

          <li>Show a downside to their class, race, or
          equipment</li>

          <li>Offer an opportunity, with or without cost</li>

          <li>Put someone in a spot</li>

          <li>Tell them the requirements or consequences and
          ask</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="NoIndent">Whenever everyone looks to you to see
        what happens choose one of these. Each move is something
        that occurs in the fiction of the game&mdash;they aren't
        code words or special terms. "Use up their resources"
        literally means to expend the resources of the
        characters.</p>

        <p>Of course you don't say that to the players. You never
        speak the name of your move (it's one of your principles).
        You make it a real thing that happens to them: "As you
        dodge the hulking ogre's club, you slip and land hard. Your
        sword goes sliding away into the darkness. You think you
        saw where it went but the ogre is lumbering your way. What
        do you do?"</p>

        <p>No matter what move you make always follow up with "What
        do you do?" Your move is a way of fulfilling your
        agenda&mdash;part of which is to fill the character's lives
        with adventure. When a spell goes wild or the floor drops
        out from under them adventurers react.</p>

        <h3>When to Make a Move</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">You make a move when everyone looks to
        you to find out what happens. When it's your turn to say
        something in the conversation you make a move. In
        particular, you make a soft move: a move that sets up a
        future move.</p>

        <p>Making a soft move just means that you put events in
        motion, then let the players react. If they don't do
        anything about it you follow through with the full
        consequences, making another (harder) move. Showing signs
        of doom is your most versatile soft move since the doom you
        portend is a move waiting to happen.</p>

        <p>Of course your moves apply when the players undertake
        something that's not a player move. In that case the
        players will say something, like "I lay my case before the
        king, pleading for aid," and look to you to find out what
        happens. Since they haven't made a move (there's no
        leverage to make a Parley) you just respond with a soft
        move of your own as setup by the fiction.</p>

        <p>You also make a move when the players give you a golden
        opportunity. A golden opportunity is any time they ignore a
        threat or when they fail a roll (6-).</p>

        <p>When they give you a golden opportunity, you can make
        your move just as hard as you like. A hard move is one that
        is irrevocable and immediate. The players immediately feel
        the consequences of the move and have to deal with them.
        Dealing damage is a hard move, since the damage is
        immediately applied.</p>

        <p>Soft moves are useful to setup future harder moves. When
        the doom you show signs of is an onslaught of goblin
        arrows, if the players don't so something to get out of the
        way, you can follow through with damage as a hard move.
        Ignoring the oncoming arrows is a golden opportunity.</p>

        <h3>Choosing a Move</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">To choose a move, start by looking at
        the obvious consequences of the action that triggered it.
        If you already have an idea, think on it for a second to
        make sure it fits your agenda and principles and then do
        it. <strong>Let your moves snowball</strong>. Build on the
        success or failure of the characters moves and on your own
        previous moves.</p>

        <p>You can choose to save up your moves instead. Use this
        option sparingly, only when you're sure the consequences of
        their action occurred off screen and that you'll be able to
        come up with those consequences later. The saved move
        should always be used in the same physical area, such as a
        dungeon complex or sprawling swamp. Your players will come
        to expect you to make hard moves on the tail of their
        failed rolls&mdash;this will throw them off. Their actions
        will instead come back to bite them later. Be careful with
        it.</p>

        <h3>Making your Move</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">When making a move, keep your
        principles in mind. In particular, "never speak the name of
        your move" and "address the characters, not the players."
        Your moves are not mechanical actions happening around the
        table. They are concrete events happening to the characters
        in the fictional world you are describing.</p>

        <p>Note that "Deal damage" is a move, but other moves may
        include damage as well. When an ogre flings you against a
        wall you take damage as surely as if he had smashed you
        with his fists. If a monster deals damage incidentally as
        part of another move, like charging past Titanius slamming
        her to the ground, the damage dealt is equal to half the
        monster's normal damage.</p>

        <p>If a move causes damage not related to a monster, like a
        collapsing tunnel or fall into a pit, use the damage rules
        on page X (Blood and Guts chapter).</p>

        <p>After every move you make, always ask "What do you do?"
        The players' characters are the stars, remember.</p>

        <h4>Use a monster, danger, or location move</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">Each monster in an adventure has moves
        associated with it, as do many locations. A monster or
        location move is just a description of what that location
        or monster does, maybe "hurl someone away" or "bridge the
        planes." If a move (like Hack and Slash) says that a
        monster gets to make an attack, make a move with that
        monster.</p>

        <p>The overarching dangers of the adventure also have moves
        associated with them. Use these moves to bring that danger
        into play, which may mean more monsters.</p>

        <h4>Reveal an unwelcome truth</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">An unwelcome truth is a fact the
        players wish wasn't true: that the room's been trapped,
        maybe, or that the helpful goblin is actually a spy. You
        never make up an unwelcome truth when making this
        move&mdash;you just bring one to light. Reveal to the
        players just how much trouble they're in.</p>

        <h4>Show signs of doom</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">This is one of your most versatile
        moves. 'Doom' is anything bad that's coming. With this
        move, you just show them that something's going to happen
        unless they do something about it. Remember to ask "What do
        you do?"</p>

        <h4>Deal damage</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">When you deal damage you choose one
        source of damage that's fictionally threatening a character
        and apply it. In combat with a lizard man? It stabs you.
        Running from a collapsing tunnel? Some rocks catch your
        ankle.</p>

        <p>The amount of damage is decided by the source. In some
        cases, this move might involve trading damage both ways,
        with the player character also dealing damage.</p>

        <p>Most damage is based on a dice roll. When a player takes
        damage, tell them what to roll, you never need to touch the
        dice. If the player is too cowardly to find out their own
        fate, they can ask another player to roll for them.</p>

        <p>Dealing damage is a hard move. Use it carefully.</p>

        <h4>Use up their resources</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">Surviving in a dungeon, or anywhere
        dangerous, often comes down to supplies. With this move,
        something happens to use up some resource: weapons, armor,
        healing, ongoing spells. You don't always have to use it up
        permanently. A sword might just be flung to the other side
        of the room, not shattered.</p>

        <h4>Offer an opportunity, with or without cost</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">Show them something they want: riches,
        power, glory. If you want, you can associate some cost with
        it too, of course.</p>

        <p>Remember to lead with the fiction. You don't say "This
        area isn't dangerous so you can make camp here, if you're
        willing to take the time." You make it a solid fictional
        thing and say "Helferth's blessings still hang around the
        shattered alter. It's clearly been untouched, the goblins
        don't come here. It's a nice safe spot, but the chanting
        from the ritual chamber is getting louder. What do you
        do?"</p>

        <h4>Put someone in a spot</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">A spot is someplace where they have to
        make tough, ugly choices. Put them in the path of
        destruction. Put someone or something they care about in a
        dangerous situation. Whatever you do, just make sure
        they're someplace where they have to take action and then
        ask "What do you do?"</p>

        <h4>Tell them the requirements or consequences and ask</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">This move is particularly good when
        they've done something that's not a move, or failed a move.
        They can do it, sure, but they'll have to meet the
        requirements. Or, they can do it, but there will be
        consequences. Maybe they can swing across the chasm, fully
        armored, and leap into battle, but the rope will be
        stressed beyond usefulness afterwards. Maybe they can swim
        through the crocodilian-infested moat before being
        devoured, but they'll need a distraction. Of course this is
        made clear to the characters, not just the players: the
        crocodilians are slavering hungry and starved, or the rope
        already has dangerous give.</p>

        <h2>Dungeon Moves</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Dungeon Moves are a special subset that
        are used to make or alter a dungeon on the fly. Use these
        if your players are exploring a hostile area that you don't
        already have planned all the way through.</p>

        <p>Map out the area being explored as you make these moves.
        Most of them will require you to add a new room or element
        to your map.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Change the environment</li>

          <li>Point to a looming threat</li>

          <li>Introduce a new faction or type of creature</li>

          <li>Use a threat from an existing faction or type of
          creature</li>

          <li>Make them backtrack</li>

          <li>Present riches at a price</li>

          <li>Present a challenge to one of the characters</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="NoIndent">You can make these moves whenever
        everyone looks to you to say something, when the players
        present you an opportunity, or when the players miss on a
        roll. They're particularly well-suited for when the players
        look at you to find out what a new room or area is
        like.</p>

        <h4>Change the environment</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">The environment is the general feel of
        the area the players are in: carved tunnels, warped trees,
        safe trails, or whatever else. This is your opportunity to
        introduce them to a new environment: the tunnels gradually
        become naturally carved, the trees are dead, or the trails
        are lost and the wilderness takes over. Use this move to
        vary the types of areas and creatures the players will
        face.</p>

        <p>It's an opportunity for you to interject with a change
        in scenery and play up the themes and dangers that are to
        come. Snowball this move with itself over time to gradually
        shift the dungeon to something new and exciting by using
        one or two elements at a time. First the scent of brimstone
        fills the tunnels, then hellish sigils mar the walls, then
        the moans of the damned and before the players know it,
        they're not in a cavern at all&mdash;they're in the pit of
        a demon lord!</p>

        <h4>Point to a looming threat</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">If you know that something lurking and
        waiting for the players to stumble upon it, this move shows
        them the signs and clues. This move is the dragon's
        footprints in the mud or the slimy trail of the gelatinous
        cube.</p>

        <p>This move means that when the players finally come
        face-to-face with the threat, they'll have some ideas and
        fear about what awaits them. Use it to build tension or, in
        some cases, provide hints that prove to be a surprise. It's
        not a wicked red dragon like the players expected, it's a
        wounded silver drake who needs their help.</p>

        <h4>Introduce a new faction or type of creature</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">A type of creatures is a broad
        grouping: orcs, goblins, lizardmen, golems, etc.</p>

        <p>A faction is a group of creatures united by a similar
        goal. Once you introduce them you can begin to make moves
        and cause trouble for the players with those creatures or
        NPCs.</p>

        <p>Introducing means giving some clear sensory evidence or
        substantiated information. Don't be coy, the players should
        have some idea what you're showing the presence of. You
        can, however, be subtle in your approach. No need to have
        the cultist overlord waving a placard and screaming in the
        infernal tongue every single time.</p>

        <p>You don't have to warn the players about this move. A
        hard application of this move will snowball directly into a
        combat scene or ambush.</p>

        <h4>Use a threat from an existing faction or type of
        creature</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">Once the characters have some been
        introduced to the presence a faction or type of creature
        you can use monsters of that type.</p>

        <p>Use the factions and types broadly. Orcs are accompanied
        with their hunting worgs. A mad cult probably has some
        undead servants or maybe a few beasts summoned from the
        deepest pits. This is a move that, often, you'll be making
        subconsciously&mdash;it's just implementing the tools
        you've set out for yourself in a clear and effective
        manner.</p>

        <h4>Make them backtrack</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">Look back at the spaces you've added to
        the map. Is there anything useful there as yet
        undiscovered? Can you add a new obstacle that can only be
        overcome by going back there? Is there a locked door here
        and now whose key lies in an earlier room?</p>

        <p>When backtracking, take the opportunity to show the
        effect the players have had on the areas they've left
        behind. What new threats have sprung up in their wake? What
        didn't they take care of that's waiting for their
        return?</p>

        <p>Use this move the make the dungeon a living, breathing
        place. There is no stasis in the wake of the characters'
        passing. Add reinforcements, cave in walls, cause chaos.
        Make the dungeon evolve in the wake of the characters'
        actions.</p>

        <h4>Present riches at a price</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">What do the players want? What might
        they give something up for?</p>

        <p>Put some desirable item just out of reach. Find
        something they're short on: time, HP, gear, whatever. Find
        a way to make what they want available if they give up what
        they have.</p>

        <p>The simplest way to use this move is the promise of gold
        out of the way of the main objective. Will they stop to pry
        the ruby eyes from the idol when they know that the virgin
        sacrifice looms closer and closer? Use this move and you
        can find out.</p>

        <h4>Present a challenge to one of the characters</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">Challenge a character by looking at
        what they're good at. Give the Thief a lock to pick, show
        the Cleric evil gods to battle against. Give the Wizard
        magical mysteries to investigate. Show the Fighter some
        skulls he can crack. Give someone a chance to shine.</p>

        <p>As an alternative, challenge a character by looking at
        what they're bad at or what they've left unresolved. If the
        Bard has a long con running what steps will he take to
        cover it up when someone figures him out? If the Wizard has
        been summoning demons then what happens when word gets
        out?</p>

        <p>This move can give a character the spotlight&mdash;even
        if just for a moment. Try to give everyone a chance to be
        the focus of play using this move from session to
        session.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div xmlns:aid="http://ns.adobe.com/AdobeInDesign/4.0/">
      <h1>First Session</h1>

      <div>
        <p class="NoIndent">The first session of a game of Dungeon
        World begins with character creation. Character creation is
        also world creation, the details on the character sheets
        and the questions the GM asks establish what Dungeon World
        is like&mdash;who lives in it and what's going on.</p>

        <p>This section is for the GM so it's addressed to
        you&mdash;the GM. For the players, the first session is
        just like every other. They just have to play their
        characters like real people and explore Dungeon World. The
        GM has to do a little more in the first session. They
        establish the world and the threats the players will face.
        Don't worry, it's fun.</p>

        <h2>Prep</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Before the first session, you'll need
        to print some stuff. Print off:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A few copies of the basic moves and special moves
          (double sided, basic on one side and special on the
          other). You'll want about one per player.</li>

          <li>One copy of each class sheet, double sided.</li>

          <li>One copy each of the cleric and wizard spell sheets,
          double sided.</li>

          <li>A few copies of the equipment sheet.</li>

          <li>The GM moves.</li>

          <li>The GM worksheets.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="NoIndent">You'll also need to read this whole
        book, especially the sections on GMing (GM moves) and the
        basic moves. It's a good idea to be acquainted with the
        class moves too, so you can be prepared for them. Be
        especially sure to read the rules for Fronts, but don't
        create any yet.</p>

        <p>Think about fantastic worlds, strange magic, and foul
        beasts. If you've played other fantasy games like Dungeons
        and Dragons think back to what made your old games so much
        fun. Remember the games you played and the stories you
        told. They can all provide inspiration for your Dungeon
        World game. Watch some movies, read some comics; get heroic
        fantasy into your brain.</p>

        <p>What you bring to the first session, ideas-wise, is up
        to you. At the very least bring your head full of ideas.
        That's the bare minimum.</p>

        <p>If you like you can plan a little more. Maybe think of
        an evil plot, or who's behind it, or some monsters you'd
        like to use.</p>

        <p>If you've got some spare time on your hands you can even
        draw some maps (but remember, from your Principles: leave
        blanks) and imagine specific locations. Flexibility is key
        when planning: what happens during character creation
        trumps anything you wrote ahead of time.</p>

        <p>The one thing you absolutely can't bring to the table is
        a planned storyline or plot. You don't know the heroes or
        the world before you sit down to play so planning anything
        concrete is just going to frustrate you. It also conflicts
        with your Agenda: play to find out what happens.</p>

        <p>Don't use the Fronts rules (in the next chapter) for the
        first session either. Those will come with time but in the
        first session you need to be able to focus more on getting
        the game rolling. The big picture doesn't matter so much,
        yet. Instead focus on getting the players into action,
        interacting with each other, and using the rules.</p>

        <h3>Getting Started</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">When everyone shows up for the first
        session briefly introduce anyone who hasn't played before
        to Dungeon World. Cover the mechanical basis of moves.
        Introduce the character classes, help players pick their
        classes, and walk them through character creation.</p>

        <p>During this entire process, especially character
        creation, ask questions. Look for interesting facts
        established by the characters' Bonds, moves, classes, and
        descriptions and ask about those things. Be curious! When
        someone mentions the demons that slaughtered their village
        find out more about them. After all, you don't have
        anything (except maybe a dungeon) and everything they give
        you is fuel for future adventures.</p>

        <p>Also pay attention to the players' questions. When
        mechanical questions come up answer them. When questions of
        setting or fiction come up your best bet is to turn those
        questions around. When a player says "Who is the King of
        Torsea" say "I don't know. Who is it? What is he like?"
        Collaborate with your players. Asking a question means it's
        something that interests them so work with them to make the
        answers interesting. Don't be afraid to say "I don't know"
        and ask them the same questions; work together to find a
        fantastic and interesting answer.</p>

        <p>Share the ideas you've brought to the table (either
        general ones or even a specific dungeon). If you're
        interested in starting with the players hunting for a lost
        wizard, tell them that. Until the players agree, it's just
        your idea. Once they nod their heads, it's part of the
        game.</p>

        <p>Once everyone has their characters created you can take
        a deep breath. Look back over the questions you've asked
        and answered so far. You should have some notes that will
        point you towards what the game might look like. Look at
        what the players have brought to the table. Look at the
        ideas that've been stewing away in your head. It's time for
        the adventure to begin!</p>

        <h3>The First Adventure</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">The first adventure is really about
        finding out what future sessions will deal with. Throughout
        the first adventure keep your eye out for unresolved
        threats; note dangerous things that are mentioned but not
        dealt with. These will be fuel for future sessions.</p>

        <p>Start the session with a group of player characters
        (maybe all of them) in a tense situation. Use anything that
        demands action: outside the entrance to a dungeon, ambushed
        in a fetid swamp, peeking through the crack in a door at
        the orc guards, or being sentenced before the King. If the
        situation stems directly from the characters and your
        questions, all the better.</p>

        <p>Here's where the game starts. The players will start
        saying and doing things, which means they'll start making
        moves. For the first session you should watch especially
        carefully for when moves apply, until the players get the
        hang of it. Often, in the early sessions, the players will
        be most comfortable just narrating their actions&mdash;this
        is fine. When a move triggers let them know. Say "It sounds
        like you're trying to&hellip;" and then walk them through
        the move. Players looking for direction will look to their
        character sheet. Be quick to ask "so what are you actually
        doing?" when a player just says "I Hack and Slash him."
        Ask, too, "how?" or "with what?".</p>

        <p>For the first session, you have a few specific
        goals:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Establish details, describe</li>

          <li>Use what they give you</li>

          <li>Ask questions</li>

          <li>Leave blanks</li>

          <li>Look for interesting facts</li>

          <li>Help the players understand the moves</li>

          <li>Give each character a chance to shine</li>

          <li>Introduce NPCs</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Establish details, describe</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">All the ideas and visions in your head
        don't really exist in the fiction of the game until you
        share them, describe them and detail them. The first
        session is the time to establish the basics of what things
        look like, who's in charge, what they wear, what the world
        is like, what the immediate location is like. Describe
        everything but keep it brief enough to expand on later. Use
        a detail or two to make a description really stand out as
        real.</p>

        <h4>Use what they give you</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">The best part of the first session is
        you don't have to come with anything concrete. You might
        have a dungeon sketched out but the players provide the
        real meat&mdash;use it. They'll emerge from the darkness of
        that first dungeon and when they do and their eyes adjust
        to the light, you'll have built up an exciting world to
        explore with their help. Look at their Bonds, their moves,
        how they answer your questions and use those to fill in the
        world around the characters.</p>

        <h4>Ask questions</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">You're using what they give you, right?
        What if you need more? That's when you draw it out by
        asking questions. Poke and prod about specific things. Ask
        for reactions "what does Lux think about that?" "is Avon
        doing something about it?"</p>

        <p>If you ever find yourself at a loss, pause for a second
        and ask a question. Ask one character a question about
        another. When a character does something, ask how a
        different character feels or reacts. Questions will power
        your game and make it feel real and exciting. Use the
        answers you find to fill in what might happen next.</p>

        <h4>Leave blanks</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">This is one of your Principles, but
        it's especially true during the first session. Every blank
        is another cool thing waiting to happen, leave yourself a
        stock of them.</p>

        <h4>Look for interesting facts</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">There are some ideas that, when you
        hear them, just jump out at you. When you hear one of those
        ideas, just write it down. When a player mentions the Duke
        of Sorrows being the demon he bargained with, note it. That
        little fact is the seed for a whole world.</p>

        <h4>Help the players understand the moves</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">You've already read the game, the
        players may not have, so it's up to you to help them if
        they need it. The fact is, they likely won't need it much.
        All they have to do is describe what their character does,
        the rules take care of the rest.</p>

        <p>The one place they may need some help is remembering the
        triggers for the moves. Keep an ear out for actions that
        trigger moves, like attacking in melee or consulting their
        knowledge. After a few moves the players will likely
        remember them on their own.</p>

        <h4>Give each character a chance to shine</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">As a fan of the heroes (remember your
        Agenda?) you want to see them do what they do best. Give
        them a chance at this, not by tailoring every room to their
        skills, but by portraying a fantastic world (Agenda again)
        where there isn't one solution to everything.</p>

        <h4>Introduce NPCs</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">NPCs bring the world to life. If every
        monster does nothing more than attack and every blacksmith
        sets out their wares for simple payment the world is dead.
        Instead give your characters, especially those that the
        players show an interest in, life (Principles, remember?).
        Introduce NPCs but don't protect them. The
        recently-deceased Goblin King is just as useful for future
        adventures as the one who's still alive.</p>

    <div xmlns:aid="http://ns.adobe.com/AdobeInDesign/4.0/">
      <h1>Fronts</h1>

      <div>
        <p class="NoIndent">Fronts are secret tomes of GM
        knowledge. With the exception of a few sneaky PC tricks
        Fronts are your purview and are a place where you&rsquo;ll
        build the adversaries, organizations, and other misfortune
        that the characters will come in conflict with. A Front is
        a collection of linked Dangers&mdash;threats to the
        characters specifically and to the people, places, and
        things the characters care about. It also includes one or
        more Impending Dooms, the horrible things that will happen
        without the players' intervention. &ldquo;Fronts&rdquo;
        comes, of course, from &ldquo;fighting on two fronts&rdquo;
        which is just where you want the characters to
        be&mdash;surrounded by threats, danger and adventure.</p>

        <p>Fronts are built outside of active play. They&rsquo;re
        the solo fun that you get to have between
        games&mdash;rubbing your hands and cackling evilly to
        yourself as you craft the foes with which to challenge your
        PCs. You may tweak or adjust the Fronts during play (who
        knows when inspiration will strike?) but the meat of them
        comes from preparation between sessions.</p>

        <p>Fronts are designed to help you organize your thoughts
        on PC opposition. They&rsquo;re here to contain your notes,
        ideas, and plans for these opposing forces. When
        you&rsquo;re in a bind your Fronts are where you&rsquo;re
        going to turn and say &ldquo;oh, so <em>that</em>&rsquo;s
        what I should do&rdquo;. Consider them an organizational
        tool, as inspiration for present and future mayhem.</p>

        <p>When you&rsquo;re building Fronts, think about all the
        creepy dungeon denizens, the rampaging hordes and ancient
        cults that you&rsquo;d like to see in your game. Think in
        broad strokes at first and then, as you build Dangers into
        your Fronts, you&rsquo;ll be able to narrow those ideas
        down. When you write your Campaign Front, think about
        session&mdash;to&mdash;session trends. When you write your
        Adventure Fronts, think about what&rsquo;s important right
        here and right now. When you&rsquo;re done writing a few
        Fronts you&rsquo;ll be equipped with all the tools
        you&rsquo;ll need to challenge your players and ready to
        run Dungeon World.</p>

        <h3>Campaign and Adventure Fronts</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">At their core, all Fronts contain the
        same components. They sort and gather your Dangers into
        easy&mdash;to&mdash;use clusters. There are, however, two
        different <em>kinds</em> of Fronts available to you. On the
        session&mdash;to&mdash;session level there&rsquo;s your
        Adventure Fronts. These Fronts will see use for 3 or 4
        sessions each. They&rsquo;re tied to one problem and will
        be dealt with or cast aside as the characters wander the
        dungeon or uncover the plot at hand. Think of them as
        episodic content: &ldquo;Today, on Dungeon
        World&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Tying your Adventure Fronts together is your Campaign
        Front. While the Adventure Fronts will contain immediate
        Dangers&mdash;the Orcs in Hargrosh Pass, say&mdash;the
        Campaign Front contains the Dark God Grishkar who drives
        the Orcs to their pillaging. The Campaign Front is the
        unifying element that spans your all the sessions of your
        Dungeon World game. It will have slower&mdash;burning
        Portents but they&rsquo;ll be bigger in scope and have a
        deeper impact on the world. Most importantly they'll be
        scarier if they're allowed to resolve.</p>

        <p>When a Danger from an Adventure Front goes without
        resolution you&rsquo;ll have to make a decision. If the
        Danger is something you like and feel has a place in the
        larger story of your game don&rsquo;t hesitate to move it
        to the Campaign Front. You&rsquo;re able to make smaller
        Dangers that went unresolved into bigger Dangers some day
        later on. You can move Dangers from the Campaign Fronts to
        the an Adventure Front if you&rsquo;re ready for the big
        showdown, too.</p>

        <h2>Creating Fronts</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Here&rsquo;s how a Front comes
        together:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Choose Campaign Front or Adventure Front</li>

          <li>Create 2&ndash;3 Dangers</li>

          <li>Choose their Impending Doom</li>

          <li>(For an Adventure Front, 1&ndash;3 Grim
          Portents)</li>

          <li>(For the Campaign Front, 3&ndash;5 Grim
          Portents)</li>

          <li>Write 1&ndash;3 stakes questions</li>

          <li>List the general cast of the Front</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Creating Dangers</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Not every single element of your game
        will warrant a Danger&mdash;traps, some roving monsters and
        other bits of ephemera may just be there to add flavour but
        aren't important enough to warrant inclusion. That&rsquo;s
        okay. Fronts are here to keep you appraised of the bigger
        picture. Dangers are divided into a handful of categories,
        each with its own name and <strong>impulse</strong>.</p>

        <p>Every Danger has a crucial motivation that drives it
        called its "impulse." The impulse exists to help you
        understand that Danger. What pushes it to fulfill its
        Impending Doom? Impulse can help you translation the Danger
        into action.</p>

        <p>When creating Dangers for your Front, think about how
        each one interacts as a facet of the Front as a whole. Keep
        in mind the people, places, and things that might be a part
        of the threat to the world that the Front represents. How
        does each Danger contribute to the Front?</p>

        <p class="Example">Let's say we have an idea for a
        Front&mdash;an ancient portal has been discovered in the
        icy north. We'll call our Front "The Opening of the White
        Gate".</p>

        <p>The easiest place to start is with people and monsters.
        Cultists, ogre chieftains, demonic overlords and the like
        are all excellent Dangers. These are the creatures that
        have risen above mere monster status to become serious
        threats on their own. Groups of monsters, too, can be
        Dangers&mdash;goblin tribes or a rampaging centaur khanate,
        for example.</p>

        <p class="Example">For the Front we're creating, we can
        pick a few different groups or people who might be
        interested in the gate. The College of Arcanists, perhaps.
        There's a golem, too, we've decided, that protects the
        forgotten portal. The golem is just an obstacle, so we
        won't make him a Danger.</p>

        <p>Thinking more broadly, less obvious elements of the
        world can be Dangers. Blasted landscapes, intelligent
        magical items, ancient spells woven into the fabric of
        time. These things fulfill the same purposes as a mad
        necromancer&mdash;they're part of the Front, a Danger to
        the world.</p>

        <p class="Example">For our Front, we'll add the Gate
        itself.</p>

        <p>Lastly, if we think ahead, we can include some
        overarching Dangers. The sorts of things that are in play
        outside the realm of the obvious&mdash;godly patrons,
        hidden conspiracies and cursed prophecies waiting to be
        fulfilled.</p>

        <p class="Example">Perhaps the White Gate was carved in the
        ancient past, hidden by a race of Angels until the Day of
        Judgement. We'll add the "Argent Seraphim" to our
        Front.</p>

        <p>Of course, there's so much more I could add to my Front,
        but there's two reasons not to go overboard: firstly, I
        want to leave room for discovery. Like a map, blank spaces
        can always be filled in later. Leaving room for player
        contribution and future inspiration means I'll have freedom
        to alter the Front and make it fit the game as the story
        emerges. Secondly, not every bad thing that could happen
        deserves Danger&mdash;hood. If you're uncertain, think
        about it this way: Dangers can always get worse.</p>

        <p class="Example">A barbarian tribe near the Gate, the
        frozen tundra itself, a band of rival adventurers; all
        these things could be dangerous elements of the game but
        they're not important enough just yet to deserve to be
        Dangers.</p>

        <p>Creating Dangers is a way to slice up your overall Front
        concept into smaller, easier to manage pieces. Dangers are
        a tool for adding detail to the right parts of the Front
        and for making the Front easier to manage in the long
        run.</p>

        <p>Once you've named and added a Danger to the Front you
        need to choose a type for that Danger from the list below.
        Alternately you can use the list of types to inspire
        Dangers: with your Front in mind, peruse the list and pick
        one or two that fit.</p>

        <p class="Example">For our three Dangers (The College of
        Arcanists, The White Gate and the Argent Seraphim) we've
        selected Cabal, Dark Portal and Choir of Angels,
        respectively.</p>

        <h3>Description and Cast</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">Write up something short to remind you
        just what this Danger is about; something to describe it in
        a nutshell. Don&rsquo;t worry about where it&rsquo;s going
        or what could happen&mdash;Grim Portents and the Impending
        Doom will handle that for you, you'll get to those in a
        bit. If there are multiple people involved in the Danger
        (an orc warlord and his clansmen, a hateful God and his
        servants) go ahead and give them a name and a detail or two
        now. Leave yourself some space as you'll be adding to this
        section as you play.</p>

        <h3>Custom Moves</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">Sometimes, a Danger will require some
        particular move that might not exist yet. Write one or two
        you think you might need, now. They may be player moves or
        GM moves, as you see fit. Of course, if you're writing a
        player move, keep your (the GMs) hands off the dice and
        keep in mind the basic structure of a move. A 10+ is a
        complete success; a 7&ndash;9 is a partial success. On a
        miss, maybe the custom move does something specific, or
        maybe not&mdash;maybe you just get to make a move or work
        towards fulfilling a Grim Portent. The formatting of these
        moves varies from move to move. See the Advanced Delving
        chapter for details on how to create your own.</p>

        <p class="Example">For the Opening of the White Gate, I
        just know some fool PC is going to end up in the light that
        spills from the gate, so I'm writing a move to show what
        might occur.</p>

        <h3>Grim Portents</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">Grim Portents are dark designs for what
        could happen if a Danger goes unchecked. Imagine yourself a
        kind of diviner working some scrying spell into the future
        of your campaign or the adventure that the characters are
        undertaking. Think about what would happen if the Danger
        existed in the world but the PCs didn&rsquo;t. If all these
        awful things you&rsquo;ve conjured up had their run of the
        world. Scary, huh? The Grim Portents are your way to codify
        the plans and machinations of your Dangers. A Grim Portent
        can be a single interesting event or a chain of steps. When
        you&rsquo;re not sure what to do next push your Danger
        towards resolving a Grim Portent.</p>

        <p>More often than not, each Portent relies on its
        predecessors to resolve. The Orcs tear down the city only
        after the peace talks fail, for example. A simple Front
        will progress from bad to worse to much worse in a clear
        path forward. Sometimes, Grim Portents are unconnected
        pathways to the Impending Doom. The early manifestations of
        Danger might not all be related. It's up to you how complex
        your Front will be. Whenever a Danger comes to pass, check
        the other Dangers in the Front. In a complex Front, you may
        need to cross off or alter the Grim Portents. That's fine,
        you're allowed.</p>

        <p>Think of your Grim Portents as possible moves waiting in
        the wings. When the time is right, unleash them on the
        world.</p>

        <p class="Example">I've chosen a few Grim Portents for my
        new Front.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The College sends an expedition to the Gate</li>

          <li>The Key is discovered</li>

          <li>The First Trumpet sounds</li>

          <li>A Champion is chosen</li>

          <li>The Second Trumpet sounds</li>

          <li>The Herald appears</li>

          <li>The Gate is Opened</li>
        </ul>

        <br />
        <br />
         

        <p class="NoIndent">Grim Portents are the sword of
        inevitability that hangs over the characters. The struggles
        that they fight every day on the field of battle, in the
        courts of society and in the deepest dungeons of the world.
        Think about how the Dangers contribute to the Front you're
        creating, both externally (the effect of the Danger on the
        world around it) and internally (the politics or struggles
        of its parts). Keep scale in mind, too. Grim Portents
        don&rsquo;t all have to be world&mdash;shaking. They can
        simply represent a change in direction for a Danger. Some
        new way for it to cause trouble in the world.</p>

        <p>When a Grim Portent comes to pass, check it
        off&mdash;the Portent is a part of the world, now. The
        prophecy has come true! A Portent that has come to pass
        might have ramifications for your other Fronts, too. Have a
        quick look when your players aren&rsquo;t demanding your
        attention and feel free to make changes. One small Portent
        may resound across the whole Campaign in subtle ways.</p>

        <p>You can advance a Grim Portent descriptively or
        prescriptively. Descriptively means that, through play,
        you've seen the change happen, so you mark it off. Maybe
        the players sided with the goblin tribes against their
        lizardmen enemies&mdash;now the goblins control the
        tunnels. Lo and behold, this was the next step in a Grim
        Portent. Prescriptive is when, due to a failed player move
        or a golden opportunity, you advance the Grim Portent as
        your hard move. That step comes to pass, show its effects
        and keep on asking "what do you do, now?"</p>

        <h3>Impending Doom</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">At the end of every Danger's path is an
        Impending Doom. This is the final toll of the bell that
        signals the Danger&rsquo;s triumphant resolution. When a
        Grim Portent comes to pass the Impending Doom grows
        stronger, more apparent and present in the world. These are
        the Very Bad Things that every Danger, in some way, seeks
        to bring into effect. Choose one of the types of Impending
        Dooms and give it a concrete vision in your Front. These
        may change in play&mdash;often they will, as the characters
        meddle in the affairs of the world. Don't fret, you can
        change them later.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Tyranny (of the strong over the weak or the few over
          the many)</li>

          <li>Pestilence (the spread of sickness and disease, the
          end of wellness)</li>

          <li>Destruction (apocalypse, ruin and woe)</li>

          <li>Usurpation (the chain of order comes apart, someone
          rightful is displaced)</li>

          <li>Impoverishment (enslavement, the abandonment of
          goodness and right)</li>

          <li>Rampant Chaos (laws of reality, of society, or any
          order is dissolved)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When all of the Grim Portents of a danger come to pass,
        the Impending Doom sets in. The Danger is then resolved but
        the setting has changed in some drastic way&mdash;even on a
        small level. This will almost certainly change the Front at
        large, as well. Making sure that these effects are felt and
        significant to the NPCs, places, and life of the campaign
        world is a big part of making them feel real.</p>

        <h3>Stakes</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">Your stakes questions are 1&ndash;3
        questions about people, places, or groups that you're
        interested in. People include characters and NPCs, your
        choice. Remember that your agenda includes "Play to find
        out what happens?" Well this is a way of reminding yourself
        what you want to find out.</p>

        <p>Stakes are concrete and clear. Don't write stakes about
        vague feelings or incremental changes. Stakes are about
        important changes that affect the PCs and the world. A good
        stakes question is one that, when it's resolved, means that
        things will never be the same again.</p>

        <p>The most important thing about stakes is that you find
        them interesting. Your stakes should be things that you
        genuinely want to know, but that you're also willing to not
        decide. Once you've written it as a stake, it's out of your
        hands, you don't get to just make it up anymore. Now you
        have to play to find out.</p>

        <p>Playing to find out is one of the biggest rewards of
        playing Dungeon World. You've written down something tied
        to events happening in the world that you want to find out
        about&mdash;now you get to do just that.</p>

        <p>Once you have your stakes your front is ready to
        play.</p>

        <p class="Example">My stakes questions include, as tailored
        to my group:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Who will be the Champion?</li>

          <li>How will Lux respond to the Light from Beyond?</li>

          <li>Will the College be able to recruit Avon?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Resolving a Front</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Often a Front will be resolved in a
        simple and straightforward manner. A Front representing a
        single dungeon may have its Dangers killed, turned to good,
        or overcome by some act of heroism. In this case the Front
        is dissolved and set aside. Maybe there are elements of the
        Front&mdash;Dangers that go unresolved or leftover members
        of a Danger that&rsquo;s been cleared&mdash;that lives on.
        Maybe they move to the Campaign Front as brand new
        Dangers?</p>

        <p>The Campaign Front will need a bit more effort to
        resolve. It&rsquo;ll be working slowly and subtly as the
        course of the Campaign rolls along. You won&rsquo;t
        introduce or resolve it all at once, but in pieces. The
        characters work towards defeating the various minions of
        the Big Bad that lives in your Campaign Front. In the end,
        though, you&rsquo;ll know that the Campaign Front is
        resolved when the Dark God is confronted, the Undead Plague
        is wiped clear, and the heroes emerge bloodied but
        victorious. Campaign Fronts take longer to deal with, but
        in the end they&rsquo;re the most satisfying to
        resolve.</p>

        <p>When a Front is resolved, take some extra time to sit
        down and look at the aftermath. Did any Grim Portents come
        to pass? Even if a Danger is stopped, if one or two Grim
        Portents are fulfilled, the world is changed. Keep this in
        mind when you write your future Fronts. Is there anyone who
        could be moved from the now&mdash;defeated Front somewhere
        else? Anyone get promoted or reduced in stature? The
        resolution of a Front is an important event!</p>

        <p>When you resolve an Adventure Front, usually that means
        the adventure itself has been resolved. This is a great
        time to take a break and look at The Campaign Front you
        have. Let it inspire your next Adventure Front. Write up a
        new Adventure Front or polish off one you&rsquo;ve been
        working on, draw a few maps to go with it and get ready for
        the next big thing.</p>

        <h2>Multiple Adventure Fronts</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">As you start your campaign you're
        likely to have a lightly-detailed Campaign Front and a
        single, detailed Adventure Front. Characters may choose,
        part-way through an Adventure, to pursue some other course.
        You might end up with a handful of partly-resolved
        Adventure Fronts. Not only is this okay, it's a great way
        to explore a world that feels alive and organic. Always
        remember, Fronts continue along apace no matter whether the
        characters are there to see it or not. Think offscreen,
        especially where Fronts are concerned.</p>

        <p>When running two Adventure Fronts at the same time they
        can be intertwined or independent. The Anarchists
        corrupting the city from the inside are a different Front
        from the orcs massing outside the walls, but they'd both be
        in play at once. On the other hand one dungeon could have
        multiple Fronts at play within its walls: the powers and
        effects of the cursed place itself and the warring humanoid
        tribes that inhabit it.</p>

        <p>A situation warrants multiple Adventure Fronts when
        there are multiple Impending Dooms, all equally potent but
        not necessarily related. The Impending Doom of the
        Anarchists is chaos in the city, the Impending Doom of the
        orcs is its utter ruination. They are two separate Fronts
        with their own Dangers. They'll deal with each other, as
        well, so there's some room for the players choosing sides
        or attempting to turn the Dangers of one Front against the
        other.</p>

        <p>When dealing with multiple Adventure Fronts the players
        are likely to prioritize. The cult needs attention now, the
        orcs can wait, or vice versa. These decisions lead to the
        slow advancement of the neglected Front, eventually causing
        more problems for the players and leading to new
        adventures. This can get complex once you've got three or
        four Fronts in play. Take care not to get overwhelmed.</p>

      <h1>Blood and Guts</h1>

      <div>
        <p class="NoIndent">Death and dismemberment are common
        dangers for adventurers to face in Dungeon World. In the
        course of play, characters will take damage, heal, and
        maybe even die. A character's health is measure by their HP
        (HP being short for hit points). Damage subtracts from HP,
        which may lead to death. In the right conditions, or with
        medical or magical help, damage is healed and HP is
        restored.</p>

        <h2>HP</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">A character's HP is a measure of their
        stamina, endurance, and health. More HP means the character
        can fight longer and endure more before facing Death's cold
        stare. Think of HP in the abstract&mdash;a character with
        high HP can't be hit in the head any more times than one
        with low HP&mdash;they just have greater stores of energy
        to expend before it comes to blows-to-the-head.</p>

        <p>Your class tells you how many HP you get. Your
        Constitution (the score, not the modifier) always comes
        into play as well so more Constitution means more HP. If
        your Constitution permanently changes during play you
        adjust your HP to reflect your new Constitution score.
        Unless your Constitution changes your maximum HP stays the
        same.</p>

        <h3>Damage</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">When a character takes damage they
        subtract the damage dealt from their current HP. Armor
        mitigates damage; if a character has armor they subtract
        their armor's value from the damage dealt. Damage can never
        take a character below 0 HP.</p>

        <p>Damage is decided by the attacker. Each class has a base
        damage die, which may be modified by the weapon used. No
        matter the implement, the Fighter will always deal more
        damage than a Wizard&mdash;it's about training and skill.
        Monsters and other non-player characters have a static
        damage instead of a dice to roll.</p>

        <p>Player characters deal damage according to their class,
        the weapon used and the move they've made. When a character
        is armed, they deal their class's damage. If a character is
        unarmed, they probably can't deal damage, or they might do
        1 stun damage.</p>

        <p>If a move just says "deal damage" the character rolls
        their class's damage dice plus any bonuses or penalties
        from moves or weapons. If a move specifies an amount of
        damage, use that in place of the class's damage roll.</p>

        <p>Monsters' damage is listed in their description. Use
        this damage any time the monster takes direct action to
        hurt someone, even if they use a method other than their
        normal attack.</p>

        <p>Other sources of damage&mdash;like being struck by a
        chunk of a collapsing tower, or falling into a
        pit&mdash;are left to the GM based on these options:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>It threatens bruises and scrapes at worst: d4
          damage</li>

          <li>It's likely to spill some blood, but nothing
          horrendous: d6 damage</li>

          <li>It might break some bones: d8 damage</li>

          <li>It could kill a common person: d10 damage</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Add the Ignores Armor tag if the source of the damage is
        particularly large or if the damage comes from magic or
        poison.</p>

        <p>Temporary or circumstantial armor works the same way: 1
        armor for partial cover, 2 armor for major cover.</p>

        <p>Remember that damage is both prescriptive and
        descriptive: if a move says someone takes damage&mdash;they
        have been struck by the weapon or ability causing the
        damage. If a character is struck by a weapon, they take
        damage. This means that you can deal damage without making
        a move. Think of it like an implied move: if you hurt
        someone and no other move applies, you just deal your
        damage.</p>

        <p>Damage only applies when the injury is general. Falling
        into a pit trap is general, it could cause any sort of
        injury, so it's represented by HP loss. When the harm is
        specific, like an orc pulling your arm from its socket, HP
        should be part of the effect but not the entirety of it.
        The bigger issue is dealing with the newly disjointed arm:
        how do you swing a sword or cast a spell? Likewise having
        your head chopped off is not HP damage, it's just
        death.</p>

        <h4>Damage From Multiple Creatures</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">It's a brave monster that goes into
        battle alone. Most creatures fight with someone at their
        side, and maybe another at their back, and possibly an
        archer covering the rear, and so on. This can lead to
        multiple monsters dealing their damage at once.</p>

        <p>If multiple creatures attack at once roll the damage die
        for each of them and take the highest result. If some of
        the creatures deal a different amount of damage roll the
        damage with the highest potential for each creature
        involved in the attack and take the highest result.</p>

        <p class="Example">A goblin orkaster (d10+1 damage ignores
        armor) and three goblins (d6 damage) all throw their
        respective weapons&mdash;a magical acid orb for the
        orkaster, spears for the rest&mdash;at Lux as she assaults
        their barricade. I roll the highest damage, d10+1 ignores
        armor, four times: once for the orkaster, and once for each
        of the other goblins. I take the highest result, a roll of
        8, and tell Lux she takes 9 damage ignoring armor as the
        acid leaks into the scratches left by the spears.</p>

        <h3>Stun Damage</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">Stun damage is non-lethal damage. A PC
        who takes stun damage is Defying Danger to do anything at
        all, the danger being "you're stunned." A GM character that
        takes stun damage counts it against their HP as usual, but
        when they are out of HP they are knocked out, not at the
        GM's mercy.</p>

        <h3>Healing</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">There are two sources of healing in
        Dungeon World: the passage of time and medical aid.</p>

        <p>Whenever a character spends some time resting without
        aggravating their wounds they heal. The amount of healing
        is described in the move (Make Camp for a night in a
        makeshift bed, Recover for says in civilization).</p>

        <p>Medical aid, both magical and mundane, also provides
        healing. The amount of damage healed is dependent on the
        move or item used. Some moves may fully replenish HP while
        others are just enough to keep someone standing through a
        fight.</p>

        <p>No matter the source of the healing a character's HP can
        never increase over their maximum.</p>

        <h3>Death</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">Death walks the edges of every battle.
        It waits silently to claim those that fall. A characters
        who is reduced to 0 HP immediately takes his Last Breath.
        Death comes for commoner and king alike&mdash;no stat is
        added to the Last Breath roll.</p>

        <p>What lies beyond the Black Gates of Death is unknown but
        it is said that many secrets of the mortal plane are laid
        bare in what lies beyond.</p>

        <p>Death's bargains range from the simple to the costly.
        Death is capricious. One life may be traded for two more
        dead while for another Death may demand eternal
        servitude.</p>

        <p>Depending on the outcome of the Last Breath the
        character may become stable. A stable character stays at 0
        HP but is alive and unconscious. If they receive healing
        they regain consciousness and may return to battle or seek
        safety. If a stable character takes damage again they face
        Death and draw their Last Breath once more.</p>

        <h3>After Death</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">Being an adventurer isn't
        easy&mdash;it's cold nights in the wild and sharp swords
        and monsters. Sooner or later, you're going to make that
        long walk to the Black Gates and give up the ghost. In
        Dungeon World, Death is always watching and waiting for an
        adventurer to slip up and visit the other side. That
        doesn't mean you have to give it the satisfaction of
        sticking around. Death, in its way, is just another
        challenge to conquer. Even dead adventurers can rise
        again.</p>

        <p>If your character dies, you can ask the GM and the other
        players to try and resurrect you. The GM will tell them
        what it will cost to return your poor, dead character to
        life. If you're all willing to pay that cost and succeed at
        the goal set before you then your character can cross back
        over to the land of the living. The Resurrection spell is a
        special case of this: the magic of the spell gives you an
        easier way to get a companion back, but the GM still has a
        say.</p>

        <p>While this quest is underway you can play a new
        character. Maybe a hireling becomes a full-fledged
        adventurer worthy of a whole share and a part in the real
        action. Maybe the characters in the party find a new friend
        in a steading, willing to join them. Maybe your character
        had a vengeful family member who now seeks to take up their
        blades and spells to make right what happened. In any case,
        make your new character as you normally would at level 1.
        Add Bonds with the other player characters and join in the
        quest to resurrect the fallen. When the price has been paid
        and the quest is done, you can choose which character to
        play. You can then retire your new character to safety or
        simply have them vanish into the background. At the start
        of any given session, choose which character you'll be
        playing that time around and set the other aside. Make sure
        this change makes sense in the story you've
        created&mdash;characters can't just appear out of nowhere
        without a good excuse.</p>

        <p>GM, when you tell the players what needs to be done to
        bring their comrade back, don't feel like it has to derail
        the flow of the current game. Weave it in to your fronts,
        steadings and prep. This is a great opportunity to change
        focus or introduce an element you've been waiting to show
        off. Don't feel, either, that it has to be some great and
        epic quest. If the character died at the end of a goblin
        pike, maybe all it takes is an awkward walk home and a few
        thousand gold pieces donated to a local temple. Think about
        the ramifications of such a charitable act and how it might
        affect the world, give the character back his sweet, sweet
        life and remember; Death never forgets a soul stolen from
        his realm.</p>

        <h2>Debilities</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Losing HP is a general thing, it's
        getting tired, bruised, cut, and so on. Some wounds are
        deeper though. These are debilities.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Weak (Str): You can't exert much force. Maybe some
          important muscles were slashed, or maybe the strength was
          pulled out of you by magic.</li>

          <li>Shaky (Dex): You're a little unsteady on your feet
          and you've got a shake in your hands.</li>

          <li>Sick (Con): Something just isn't right deep inside.
          It could be a disease or it might be an organ swollen to
          bursting.</li>

          <li>Stunned (Int): You're having trouble&hellip;
          remembering? Is that how that sentence ends?</li>

          <li>Confused (Wis): Ears ringing. Vision blurred. You're
          more than a little out of it.</li>

          <li>Scarred (Cha): It may not be permanent, but for now
          you don't look so good. Your voice is probably weak
          too.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Debilities are inflicted by certain monsters. Not every
        attack inflicts a debility&mdash;they're most often
        associated with magic, poison, or stranger things like a
        vampire sucking your blood. Each debility is tied to a stat
        and gives you -1 to that stat's modifier. The stat's score
        is unaffected so you don't have to worry about changing
        your Load when you're Weak.</p>

        <p>You can only have each debility once. If you're already
        Sick and something makes you Sick you just ignore it.</p>

        <p>Debilities are harder to heal than HP. Some high level
        magic can do it, sure, but your best bet is getting
        somewhere safe and spending a few days in a soft warm bed.
        Of course debilities are both descriptive and prescriptive:
        if something happens that would remove a debility, that
        debility is gone.</p>

        <p>Debilities don't replace descriptions and using the
        established fiction. When someone loses an arm that isn't
        Weak, that's losing an arm. They can't hold a shield, to
        begin with. Don't let debilities limit you. A specific
        disease can have whatever effects you can dream up, Sick is
        just a convenient shorthand for some anonymous fever picked
        up from a filthy rat.</p>

        <h2>Advancement</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Dungeon World is ever-changing. The
        characters change, too. As their adventures progress,
        player characters gain experience or XP, which lets them
        level up. This prepares them for greater danger, bigger
        adventures, and mightier deeds.</p>

        <p>Advancement, like everything else in Dungeon World, is
        both prescriptive and descriptive. Prescriptive means that
        when a player changes their character sheet the character
        changes. Descriptive means that when the character changes
        the player should change the character sheet to reflect
        that.</p>

        <p>This isn't a benefit or detriment to the players or the
        GM; it's not an excuse to gain more powers or take them
        away. It's just a reflection of life in Dungeon World.</p>

        <p class="Example">Gregor offers his signature weapon, an
        axe permanently dyed green in orc blood, as a desperate
        bargain to save the King from eternal damnation. Without
        his axe he gets none of the benefits of his signature
        weapon. Should he recover it he'll have access to its
        benefits again.</p>

        <p class="Example">Avon, despite being a Wizard, has risen
        to the notice of Lenoral, the deity of arcane knowledge.
        After being blessed by an avatar of Lenoral, Avon is under
        the deity's watch. He can fulfill Petitions and gain boons
        like a Cleric.</p>

        <p>Descriptive changes only happen when the character has
        clearly gained access to an ability. Befriending a stray
        dog does not have the same benefits as an animal
        companion.</p>

        <h3>Level Up</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">When you <strong>have a safe moment and
        XP equal to (or greater than) your current level +
        7</strong>, reset your XP to 0 and choose a new advanced
        move from your class. If you are the Wizard, you also get
        to add a new spell to your spellbook.</p>

        <p>New moves are chosen based on the character's new level.
        If a move requires 6th level, it's available as the
        character advances from 5th to 6th level.</p>

        <p>If your new level is 3, 6, or 9, you also get to
        increase a stat by 2. Increase the base score of the stat
        of your choice by 2, adjust the modifier to reflect the new
        score. Changing your Constitution increases your maximum
        and current HP. Ability scores can't go higher than 18.</p>

        <h3>Requires &amp; Replaces</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">Some moves depend on other moves. If
        another move is listed along with the word
        <strong>Requires</strong> or <strong>Replaces</strong> you
        can only gain the new move if you have the move it requires
        or replaces.</p>

        <p>A move the requires another move can only be taken if
        you have the move it requires already. You then have both
        moves and they both apply.</p>

        <p>A move that replaces another move can only be taken if
        you have the move it replaces already. You lose access to
        the replaced move and just have the new one. The new move
        will usually include all the benefits of the replaced one:
        maybe you replace a move that gives you 1 armor with one
        that gives you 2 armor instead.</p>

        <h2>Bonds</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Bonds are what make you a party of
        adventurers, not just a random assortment of people. Seeing
        your bonds evolve and play off each other is one of the
        best parts of the game.</p>

        <p>That said, this isn't high drama. How you feel about
        Titanius doesn't matter so much when you're both fighting
        for life and limb against a horde of demons who would
        happily end the world if they could. Bonds are the icing on
        the cake: they make your adventures (and your adventurers)
        more interesting.</p>

        <h3>Resolving Bonds</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">At the end of each session you may
        resolve one bond. Resolution of a bond depends on both you
        and the player of the character you share the bond with:
        you suggest that the bond has been resolved and, if they
        agree, it is.</p>

        <p>A bond is resolved when it no longer describes how you
        relate to that person. That may be because circumstances
        have changed&mdash;Thelian used to have your back but after
        he didn't rush to save you from the ankheg you're not so
        sure. Or it could be because that's no longer a
        question&mdash;you guided Wesley before and he owed you,
        but he paid that debt when he saved your life with a
        well-timed spell. Any time you look at a Bond and think
        "that's not a big factor in how we relate anymore" the bond
        is at a good place to resolve.</p>

        <p>If a character has blank Bonds left over from character
        creation they can resolve that Bond without asking anyone
        and write a new one or they can add a character's name to
        the Bond instead of writing a new Bond. Ignoring a Bond at
        character creation does not reduce the total Bonds
        available to the character.</p>

        <h3>Writing New Bonds</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">You write a new bond whenever you
        resolve an old one. Your new bond may be with the same
        character, but it doesn't have to be.</p>

        <p>When you write a new bond first choose another
        character. Then pick something relevant to the last session
        you've just finished&mdash;maybe a place you traveled
        together or a treasure you discovered. Lastly, choose a
        thought or belief your character holds that ties the two
        together and an action, something you're going to do about
        it. You'll end up with something like this:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Avon proved himself a coward in the dungeons of
          Xax'takar, he is a dangerous liability to the party and
          must be watched.</li>

          <li>Mouse's quick thinking saved me from the white dragon
          we faced. I owe her a boon.</li>

          <li>Xotoq won the Bone-and-Whispers Axe through trickery!
          It will be mine, I swear it.</li>

          <li>Valeria's kindness to the Gnomes of the Vale has
          swayed my heart. I will find a way to prove to her my
          love.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="NoIndent">These new bonds act just like the old
        ones. They are still resolved and still grant XP when
        resolved.</p>

        <p>If you chose not to use a starting Bond you can replace
        it with a new Bond at the end of any session. This does not
        count as resolving a Bond, you don't get XP for it.</p>

        <h2>Alignment</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Alignment is your characters' way of
        thinking and moral compass. For the character, this is
        reflected as an ethical ideal, religious strictures, or
        maybe just a gut instinct. It reflects the things your
        character might aspire to be and can guide you when you're
        not sure what to do next. Some characters might proudly
        proclaim their alignment while others might hide it away. A
        character might not say "I'm an evil person" but may
        instead say "I put myself first." That's all well and good
        for a character, but the world knows otherwise. Buried deep
        down inside is the ideal self a person wants to
        become&mdash;it is this mystic core that certain spells and
        abilities tap into when detecting someone's alignment.
        Every sentient creature in Dungeon World bears an
        alignment, be she an elf, a human, or some other, stranger
        thing.</p>

        <p>The alignments are Good, Lawful, Neutral, Chaotic, and
        Evil. Each one shows an aspiration to be a different type
        of person.</p>

        <p>Lawful creatures aspire to impose order on the world,
        either for their own benefit or for that of others. Chaotic
        creatures embrace change and idealize the messy reality of
        the world, prizing freedom above all else. Good creatures
        seek to put others before themselves. Evil creatures put
        themselves first at the expense of others.</p>

        <p>A Neutral creature looks out for itself so long as that
        doesn't hurt anyone else much. Neutral characters are
        content to live their lives and pursue their own goals and
        let others do the same.</p>

        <p>Most creatures are Neutral. They take no particular
        pleasure in harming others, but will do it if it is
        justified by their situation. Those that put an ideal, be
        it Law, Chaos, Good, or Evil, above themselves are
        rarer.</p>

        <p>Even two creatures of the same alignment can come into
        conflict. Aspiring to help others does not grant
        infallibility, two Good creatures may fight and die over
        two different views of how to help others. A great king may
        wage war on a free city despite his good alignment since he
        sees (justly, perhaps) that the peoples of the free city
        will live a better life under his enlightened rule.</p>

        <h3>Changing Alignment</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">Alignment can, and will, change.
        Usually such a change comes about as a gradual slide to a
        decisive moment when the pain caused becomes too great or
        the benefit too others too small.</p>

        <p>Any time a player would earn XP from their current
        alignment they can, instead of taking the XP, change the
        alignment. The player must have a reason for the change
        which they can explain to the other players. If they can't
        explain why their character has had a change of heart they
        can't change alignment. Don't abuse the privilege.</p>

        <p>The first time a player character changes alignment it
        must be to another alignment listed for their class, though
        they can choose any of the alignment moves below for a
        listed alignment. After that they can go to any alignment
        they like.</p>

        <p>In some cases a player character may switch alignment
        moves while still keeping the same alignment. This reflects
        a smaller shift, one of priority instead of a wholesale
        shift in thinking. They simply choose a new move for the
        same alignment from below and mention why their character
        now sees this as important.</p>

        <p>GM characters can change alignment as well, even if the
        players have already discerned the character's alignment.
        Since NPCs do not earn XP the GM can change the NPC's
        alignment any time it's warranted. The GM is subject to the
        same justification requirement: if an NPC with a known
        alignment is no longer that alignment the players may ask
        the GM for a reason why.</p>

      <h1>Example</h1>

      <div>
        <p class="NoIndent">I'm GMing a game with Isaac (playing
        Omar), Ben (playing Brianne), Amy (playing Nora), and Dan
        (playing Rath). The group has come upon a tribe of goblins
        preparing the ritual sacrifice of a rare and valuable
        albino crocodile (highly regarded as pets among the wealthy
        of the city).</p>

        <p>Three of the goblin warriors&mdash;drugged on narcotic
        vapors&mdash;charge the fighter Brianne, shrieking. Two
        others take cover, prepare their bows and gesture urgently
        toward Rath, as they make signs to ward off the evil eye.
        Another group of three slips into the shadows around the
        outer edge of the chamber, preparing a sneak attack. The
        high priest and her acolyte carry on with the ritual,
        rubbing the croc's upturned belly to keep it compliant, and
        bringing out the sacred knife to slit its throat.</p>

        <p>Once I describe the situation I make sure the game's a
        conversation by giving them a chance to do something: "So,
        what do you do?"</p>

        <p>Isaac jumps into the action first. "There's enough
        shadows at the edges of the chamber to hide in?" "Yeah," I
        say, "the goblins aren't much for lighting apparently. The
        edges of the chamber just kind of disappear into crumbling
        walls, rubble, and gloom." "Great! I'm going over here, the
        other side from where the sneaky ones went. Omar glances
        over his shoulders, pulls up his hood over his head, and
        ducks into the shadows. I'm going to pop out of the shadows
        right here, where the torches illuminate the sacrificial
        altar."</p>

        <p>I look over the map and say "Well, there's certainly a
        danger of being discovered that I think you're defying.
        Sounds like Dex to me, since you're moving carefully and
        silently," so he picks up the dice and rolls. The dice show
        1 and 2, plus his Dex of 2 is only 5. "Damn!" he says.</p>

        <p>I already have an idea of what to do, but I check it
        against my list of moves to be sure. Sure enough, my idea
        to have him get his foot lodged in the rubble in the
        darkness is a move, "put someone in a spot." "As you make
        your way through the shadows, you put your foot down on
        some rubble and it shifts under you, pinning your foot.
        What's worse, you hear a deep raspy breath as the shifting
        rubble awakes something in the shadows. Are you giving away
        your position to cry for help or trying to get out
        yourself?"</p>

        <p>"Um, I'm not sure."</p>

        <p>"That's fine, we'll come back to you. What are the rest
        of you doing?"</p>

        <p>Dan steps up. "Those goblins that ducked into the
        shadows? Can I see them?" "Not at first glance. Are you
        trying to pick them out?" "No, I'm just wondering if
        they'll be targets for my sleep spell. I push the winds of
        magic into a lulling summer breeze that fills the
        room."</p>

        <p>Dan rolls his Cast a Spell move to cast Sleep. He rolls
        6 total on the dice, and he has +2 Int, for a total of 8.
        He has a choice to make. "You can feel the spell slipping
        away from you, the winds of magic are already all caught up
        in the goblin's ritual sacrifice. There are some options on
        the move, which one are you taking to keep the spell?"</p>

        <p>Dan ponders his options. "I may need to put more of
        these guys to sleep. Brianne, can you cover me if I get in
        trouble or should I take the -1 forward?"</p>

        <p>"Sure, I can cover you." Ben says.</p>

        <p>"Okay, I'll take the danger option."</p>

        <p>"Great" I say. "The narcotic vapors those goblins are
        on? It attunes their senses: They can feel the winds of
        magic just a bit, and now they're all running at you
        instead of Brianne. How many creatures are you putting to
        sleep?"</p>

        <p>Dan rolls the dice. "Looks like only 1, damn."</p>

        <p>"Right in the middle of some long goblin invocation the
        priest just drops to the floor. Her acolyte immediately
        starts shaking her to wake her up. Neither of them is
        paying much attention to the albino crocodile, which is no
        longer content since no one is rubbing its belly. The
        goblins on the fumes, though, they're coming right at
        Rath."</p>

        <p>Ben jumps in. "I step between Rath and the crazed
        goblins and make myself a big target, drawing the goblin's
        attention with a yell."</p>

        <p>"Sounds like Defend" I say.</p>

        <p>"Okay, I rolled a 7, so I hold 1."</p>

        <p>"Great. The three goblins on fumes pratically bowl Rath
        over as they slam into him, swinging their daggers
        wildly."</p>

        <p>"No they don't!" Ben says. "I spend my hold to get into
        the way and direct the attack to me."</p>

        <p>"So Brianne steps in at the last moment, pushes Rath out
        of the way, and the goblins lay into her instead. Looks
        like 5 damage. Nora, Brianne's got these three psychotic
        goblins all over her, Rath's just put the priestess to
        sleep, the crocodile's stirring, and Omar's nowhere to be
        found. What are you doing?"</p>

        <p>"First I line up a shot on one of the archer goblins,
        and while I'm doing that I give a little head nod and Canto
        heads off into the shadows, he's trained to hunt, he's
        looking for Omar to make sure he's alright."</p>

        <p>I look over the Ranger's Command move, to make sure I
        know what the effects of Canto's search are, before
        responding. "Well, on his own Canto will probably find Omar
        in a while. If you go into the darkness with him you'll his
        bonus to your Discern Realities roll to find Omar. But
        first it sounds like you're making a Called Shot?"</p>

        <p>"Oh, the goblin archers are surprised by me? I thought I
        was just volleying" Amy replies.</p>

        <p>It's time for me to make a call. "No, they're entirely
        focused on Rath, they're about to fire on him. I think
        you've got the element of surprise because they're just too
        focused."</p>

        <p>"Great! Then I'll go ahead and take a shot at the arms
        of the one closest to me, I want him to drop his bow. Looks
        like that's +Dex&hellip; 10! He drops his bow and takes 4
        damage."</p>

        <p>I consult the goblin's stats first, then reply "yup,
        that'll kill him. And since you hit him dead in the arm, he
        doesn't get a shot off. The other one, however, releases
        his shot at Rath, for 2 damage. Rath, Brianne pushes you
        out of the way and you think you're safe for a split second
        before an arrow flies into your leg, what are you doing
        about it? Actually, hold that thought, let's see what
        Omar's doing."</p>

        <p>Isaac's had some time to think things through now. "This
        deep raspy breath, can I make out where it's coming from?
        Is it like a human-sized rasp or a monster-sized rasp?"</p>

        <p>"Sounds to me like you're trying to listen to your
        senses and get some information." I'm hoping that this will
        remind Isaac there's a move for this, instead of just
        telling him to make the move.</p>

        <p>"Oh yeah! So I'm Discerning Realities, staying as quiet
        as I can and just trying to pick up any detail on what this
        thing is. With my Wisdom that's a 7, whew. What should I be
        on the lookout for?"</p>

        <p>I take a second to look over my notes and the map, just
        to make sure I give him all the information. "Well, not the
        goblins, actually. They pass by, closer to the light then
        you, intent on backstabbing your friends and not noticing
        you. The thing that you do see is the tip of this huge
        crocodile snout peak over a mound of rubble, with that
        rasping sound coming from it. It looks like the albino
        crocodile has family, and it's big, horse-size. If you make
        noise by moving rocks and getting unstuck it'll almost
        certainly hear you. What are you doing about that?"</p>

        <p>Isaac ponders. "So, I can try to get out of here,
        Defying Danger most likely from the sounds of it.
        Or&hellip; I tear off a piece of my cloak and soak it in an
        entire dose of my Goldenroot poison. It's an applied
        poison, but if I can get this huge crocodile to swallow it
        before it swallows me it'll treat me as a trusted ally, and
        then I can use it against the goblins."</p>

        <p>"Okay!" That sounds like a risky plan to me, but it's
        just crazy enough to work. Time to cut back to someone
        else. "Omar's soaking poison into a scrap of cloak,
        Brianne's got three drugged-up goblins scraping at her,
        Nora's got an eye out for Omar, there are goblin sneaks in
        the shadows, one goblin archer by the alter, the crocodile
        is waking up, and Rath just took an arrow to the knee.
        Whew. Rath, what are you doing about that arrow?"</p>

      <h1>The world</h1>

      <div>
        <p class="NoIndent">Much of the adventuring life is spent
        in dusty, forgotten tombs or in places of terror and
        life-threatening danger. It's commonplace to awaken from a
        short and fitful rest, still deep in the belly of the world
        and surrounded by foes. When the time comes to emerge from
        these kinds of places&mdash;whether laden with the spoils
        of battle or beaten and bloody&mdash;an adventurer seeks
        out safety and solace.</p>

        <p>These are the comforts of civilization; a warm bath, a
        meal of mead and bread, company of fellow men and elves and
        dwarves. Often, thoughts of returning to these places are
        all that keep an adventurer from succumbing to madness in
        the depths. All fight for gold and glory but in their
        hearts, everyone wants a place to call "home".</p>

        <p>This chapter covers the wider world. The grand and
        sweeping scope outside the dungeon. The always-marching
        movement of the GMs Fronts will shape the world and, in
        turn, the world reflects the actions the players take to
        stop or redirect them.</p>

        <h3>Steadings</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">We call all the assorted communities,
        holds, and so on where there's a place to stay and some
        modicum of safety <strong>Steadings</strong>, as in
        "homestead." Steadings are places with at least a handful
        of inhabitants, usually humans, and some stable structures.
        They can be as big as a capital city or as small as few
        ramshackle buildings.</p>

        <h2>Creating the world</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Remember how you started the first
        session? With action either underway or impending? At some
        point the characters are going to need to retreat from that
        action, either to heal their wounds or to celebrate and
        resupply.</p>

        <p>When the players leave the site of their first adventure
        for the safety of civilization it's time to start drawing
        the Campaign Map. Take a large sheet of paper (plain white
        if you like or hex-gridded if you want to get fancy), place
        it where everyone can see, and make a mark for the site of
        the adventure. Use pencil, this map will change. It can be
        figurative or literal depending on your drawing skill, just
        make it obvious. Keep the marking small and somewhere
        around the center of the paper so you have space to
        grow.</p>

        <p>Now add the nearest Steading, a place the characters can
        go to rest and gather supplies. Draw a mark for that place
        on the map and fill in the space between with some terrain
        features. Try to keep the it within a day or two of the
        site of their first adventure&mdash;a short trip through a
        rocky pass or some heavy woods is suitable, or a wider
        distance by road or across open ground.</p>

        <p>When you have time (after the first session or during a
        snack break or the like) use the rules to create the first
        Steading. Consider adding marks for other places that have
        been mentioned so far, either details from character
        creation or the Steading rules themselves.</p>

        <h2>Steading Moves</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">When the players visit a Steading there
        are some special moves they'll be able to make. These still
        follow the fictional flow of the game. When the players
        arrive, ask them "What do you do?" The players' actions
        will, more often than not, trigger a move from this list.
        They represent respite, reinvigoration and resupply;
        opportunities for the players to gather their wits and
        spend their treasure. Remember that a Steading isn't a
        break from reality. You're still making hard moves when
        necessary and thinking about how the players' action (or
        inaction) leads to your Fronts advancing. The Impending
        Doom is always there, whether the players are combatting it
        in the dungeon or ignoring it while getting drunk in the
        local tavern.</p>

        <p>Let each player make one or two moves here, depending on
        how they answer your "what do you do?" question. Don't let
        a visit to a Steading become a permanent respite. Remember,
        Dungeon World is a scary, dangerous place. If the players
        choose to ignore that, make a hard move. Fill the
        characters' lives with adventure whether they're out
        seeking it or not. These moves exist to you can make a
        visit to town an interesting thing without spending a whole
        session haggling over the cost of a new baldric.</p>

        <h2 class="BasicMoveName">Carouse</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">When you <strong>return triumphant and
        throw a big party</strong>, spend 100 coin and roll + extra
        100s of coin spent. On a 10+ choose 3. On a 7&ndash;9
        choose 1. On a miss, you still choose one, but things get
        really out of hand.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>You befriend a useful NPC</li>

          <li>You hear rumors of an opportunity</li>

          <li>You gain useful information</li>

        </ul>

        <h2 class="BasicMoveName">Supply</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">When you <strong>go to buy something
        with coin on hand</strong>, if it's something readily
        available in the steading you're in, you can buy it at
        market price. If it's something special, beyond what's
        usually available here, or non-mundane, roll+Cha. On a 10+
        you find what you're looking for at a fair price. On a
        7&ndash;9 you'll have to pay more or settle for something
        similar.</p>

        <h2 class="BasicMoveName">Recover</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">When you <strong>do nothing but rest in
        comfort and safety</strong> after a day of rest you recover
        all your HP. After three days of rest you remove one
        debility of your choice. If you're under the care of a
        healer (magical or otherwise) you heal a debility for every
        two days of rest instead.</p>

        <h2 class="BasicMoveName">Recruit</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">When you <strong>put out word that

          <li>&hellip;what you're setting out to do, take +1</li>

          <li>&hellip;that they'll get a share of whatever you
          find, take +1</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="NoIndent">If you have a useful reputation around
        these parts take an additional +1. On a 10+ you've got your
        pick of a number of skilled applicants, your choice who you
        hire and no penalty for not taking them along. On a
        7&ndash;9 you'll have to settle for what you get or turn
        applicants away. On a miss someone influential and
        ill-suited declares they'd like to come along (a foolhardy
        young duke, a loose cannon mercenary, or a hidden enemy,
        for example), bring them and damn the consequences or turn
        them away and risk their ire. If you turn away applicants
        you take -1 forward to Recruit.</p>

        <h2 class="BasicMoveName">Outstanding Warrants</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">When you <strong>return to a Steading

        complication:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The local constabulary has a warrant out for your
          arrest</li>

          <li>Someone who holds a grudge makes their move</li>

          <li>Someone important to you has been put in a bad spot
          as a result of your actions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="BasicMoveName">Bolster</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">When you <strong>spend your leisure
        time in study, meditation, or hard practice,</strong> you
        gain preparation. If you prepare for a week or two, 1
        preparation. If you prepare for a month or longer, 3
        preparation. When your preparation pays off spend 1
        preparation for +1 to any roll. You can only spend one
        preparation per roll.</p>

        <h2>Elements of a Steading</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">A Steading is any bit of civilization
        that offers some amount of safety to its inhabitants.
        Villages, towns, keeps, and cities are the most common
        Steadings.</p>

        <p>Steadings are differentiated based on size. The size
        indicates roughly how many people the Steading can support.
        The population tag tells you if the current population is
        more then or less than this amount.</p>

        <p>Villages are the smallest Steadings. They're usually out
        of the way, off the main roads. If they're lucky they can
        muster some defense but it's often just rabble with
        pitchforks and torches. A village stands near some easily
        exploitable resource: rich soil, plentiful fish, an old
        forest, or a mine. There might be a store of some sort but
        more likely it's just people trading to each other. Coin is
        scarce.</p>

        <p>Towns have a few thousand inhabitants. They're the kind
        of place that springs up around a mill, trading post, or
        inn and usually have fields, farms, and livestock of some
        kind. They might have a standing militia of farmers strong
        enough to wield a blade or shoot a bow. Towns have the
        basics for sale but certainly no special goods. Usually
        they'll focus on a local product or two and do some trade
        with travelers.</p>

        <p>A Keep is a Steading built specifically for
        defense&mdash;sometimes of a particularly important
        location like a river delta or a rich gold mine. Keeps are
        found at the frontier edges of civilization. Inhabitants
        are inured to the day-to-day dangers of the road. They're
        tough folks that number between a hundred and a thousand,
        depending on the size of the Keep and the place it defends.
        Keeps won't often have much beyond their own supplies,
        traded to them from nearby villages, but will almost always
        have arms and armor and sometimes a rare magical item found
        in the local wilds.</p>

        <p>From bustling trade center to sprawling metropolis the
        City represents the largest sort of Steading in Dungeon
        World. These are places where folk of many races and kinds
        can be found. They often exist at the confluence of a
        handful of trade routes or are built in a place of
        spiritual significance. They don't often generate their own
        materials for trade, relying on villages nearby for food
        and raw material but will always have crafted goods and
        some stranger things for sale to those willing to seek
        them.</p>

        <p>Steadings are created as needed. Discovered by players,
        added as part of the prep for a Front or spawned as the
        result of the GM asking questions of the players, whatever
        the reason each Steading is created using the rules
        below.</p>

        <p>Like weapons, Steadings are described by their tags. All
        Steadings have tags indicating prosperity, population and
        defenses and many will have tags to illustrate their more
        unusual properties.</p>

        <p>Prosperity indicates what kinds of items are usually
        available. Population indicates the number of inhabitants
        relative to the current size of the steading. Defenses
        indicate the general scope of arms the steading has. Tags
        in these categories can be adjusted. -category means to
        change the steading to the next lower tag for that category
        (so Moderate would become Poor when tagged with
        -Prosperity). +category means to change the steading to the
        next higher tag (so Shrinking becomes Steady with
        +Population). Tags in those categories can also be compared
        like numbers. Treat the lowest tag in that category as 1
        and each successive tag as the next number (so Dirt is 1,
        Poor is 2, etc.).</p>

        <p>Tags will change of the course of play. Creating a
        Steading provides a snapshot of what that place looks like
        <em>right now</em>. As the players spend time in it and
        your Fronts progress the world will change and your
        Steadings with it.</p>

        <h3>Adding Steadings</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">You add your first Steading when you
        create the Campaign Map; it's the place the players go to
        to rest and recover. When you first draw it on the map all
        you need is a name and a location.</p>

        <p>When you have the time you'll use the rules below to
        create the Steading. The first Steading is usually a
        village, but you can use a town if the first adventure was
        closely tied to humans (for example, if the players fought
        a human cult). Create it using the rules below.</p>

        <p>Once you've created the first Steading you can add other
        places referenced in its tags (the Oath, Trade, and Enmity
        tags in particular) or anywhere else that's been referred
        to in play. Don't add too much in the first session, leave
        blanks and places to explore.</p>

        <p>As play progresses the characters will discover new
        locales and places of interest either directly, by
        stumbling upon them in the wild, or indirectly, by hearing
        about them in rumors or tales. Add new Steadings, dungeons,
        and other locations to the map as they're discovered or
        heard about. Villages are often near a useful resource.
        Towns are often found at the point where several villages
        meet to trade.Keeps watch over important locations. Cities
        rely on the trade and support of smaller steads. Dungeons
        can be found anywhere and in many forms.</p>

        <p>Whenever you add a new Steading use the rules to decide
        its tags. Consider adding a distinctive feature somewhere
        nearby. Maybe a forest, some old standing stones, an
        abandoned castle, or whatever else catches your fancy or
        makes sense. A map of only Steadings and ruins with nothing
        in-between is dull, don't neglect the other features of the
        world.</p>

        <h3>Steading Tags</h3>

        <h4>Prosperity</h4>

        <p><em>Dirt</em>: Nothing for sale, nobody has more than
        they need (and they're lucky if they have that). Unskilled
        labor is cheap.</p>

        <p><em>Poor</em>: Only the bare necessities for sale.
        Weapons are scarce unless the steading is heavily defended
        or militant. Unskilled labor is readily available.</p>

        <p><em>Moderate</em>: Most mundane items are available.
        Some types of skilled laborers.</p>

        <p><em>Wealthy</em>: Any mundane item can be found for
        sale. Most kinds of skilled laborers, too, but demand is
        high for their time.</p>

        <p><em>Rich</em>: Mundane items and more, if you know where
        to find them. Specialist labor available, but at high
        prices.</p>

        <h4>Population</h4>

        <p><em>Exodus</em>: The Steading has lost its population
        and is on the verge of collapse.</p>

        <p><em>Shrinking</em>: The population is less than it once
        was. Buildings stand empty.</p>

        <p><em>Steady</em>: The population is in line with the
        current size of the steading. Some slow growth.</p>

        <p><em>Growing</em>: More people than there are
        buildings.</p>

        <p><em>Booming</em>: Resources are stretched thin trying to
        keep up with the number of people.</p>

        <h4>Defenses</h4>

        <p><em>None</em>: Clubs, torches, farming tools.</p>

        <p><em>Militia</em>: There are several dozen able-bodied
        men and women with worn weapons ready to be called, but no
        standing force.</p>

        <p><em>Watch</em>: There are a few watchers posted who look
        out for trouble and settle small problems, but their main
        role is to summon the militia.</p>

        <p><em>Guard</em>: There are armed defenders at all times
        with a total pool of less than 100 (or equivalent). There
        is always at least one armed patrol about the steading.</p>

        <p><em>Garrison</em>: There are armed defenders at all
        times with a total pool of 100&ndash;300 (or equivalent).
        There are multiple armed patrols at all times.</p>

        <p><em>Battalion</em>: As many as 1,000 armed defenders (or
        equivalent). The steading has manned maintained defenses as
        well.</p>

        <p><em>Legion</em>: The Steading is defended by thousands
        of armed defenders (or equivalent). The Steading's defenses
        are intimidating.</p>

        <h4>Other Tags</h4>

        <p><em>Safe</em>: Outside trouble doesn't come here unless
        the players bring it. Idyllic and often hidden. If the
        Steading would lose or degrade another beneficial tag get
        rid of Safe instead.</p>

        <p><em>Religion</em>: The listed deity is revered here.</p>

        <p><em>Exotic</em>: There are goods and services available
        here that aren't available anywhere else nearby. List
        them.</p>

        <p><em>Resource</em>: The steading has easy access to the
        listed resource (e.g. a spice, a type of ore, fish,
        grapes). That resource is significantly cheaper.</p>

        <p><em>Need</em>: The Steading has an acute or ongoing need
        for the listed resource. That resource sells for
        considerably more.</p>

        <p><em>Oath</em>: The Steading has sworn oaths to the

        <p><em>Trade</em>: The Steading regularly trades with the
        listed Steadings.</p>

        for a price. This tends to draw more arcane casters, +1 to
        Recruit when you put out word you're looking for an
        adept.</p>

        <p><em>Divine</em>: There is a major religious presence,

        <p><em>Guild</em>: The listed type of guild has a major

        <p class="NoIndent">By default a village is Poor, Steady,
        Militia, Resource (your choice) and has an Oath to another

          <li>The village is somewhere naturally defended: Safe,
          -Defenses</li>

        <h2>Making a Town</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">By default a town is Moderate, Steady,
        Watch, and Trade (two of your choice). If the town is
        listed as Trade by another steading choose one:</p>

        <p class="NoIndent">By default a keep is Poor, Shrinking,
        Guard, Need (Supplies), Trade (someplace with supplies),
        Oath (your choice). If the keep is owed fealty by at least
        one settlement choose one:</p>

          (Battle), Blight (Restless Spirits)</li>

          <li>The keep is given the worst of the worst: Need
          (Skilled Recruits)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Making a City</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">By default a city is Moderate, Steady,
        Guard, Market, and Guild (one of your choice). It also has
        Oaths with at least two other steadings, usually a town and
        a keep. If the city has trade with at least one steading
        and fealty from at least one steading choose one:</p>

        <ul>

          +Defenses, Oath (your choice)</li>

          Need (food)</li>

          <li>The city has designs on nearby territory: Enmity
          (nearby steadings), +Defenses</li>

          +Population</li>

          <li>The city has supernatural defenses: +Defenses, Blight
          (related supernatural creatures)</li>

          <li>The city lies on a place of power: Arcane, Personage
          (whoever watches the place of power), Blight (arcane
          creatures)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Fronts on the Campaign Map</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Of course your steadings are not the
        only thing on the campaign map. In addition to steadings
        and the areas around them your fronts will appear on the
        map, albeit indirectly.</p>

        <p>Fronts are organizational tools, not something the
        characters think of, so don't put them on the map directly.
        The orcs of Olg'gothal may be a front but don't just draw
        them on the map. Instead for each front add some feature to
        the map that indicates the front's presence. You can label
        it if you like, but use the name that the characters would
        use, not the name you gave the front.</p>

        <p>For example, the orcs of Olg'gothal could be marked on
        the map with a burning village they left behind, fires in
        the distance at night, or a stream of refugees. Lord
        Xothal, a lich, might be marked by the tower where dead
        plants take root and grow.</p>

        <p>As your fronts change, change the map. If the players
        cleanse Xothal's tower redraw it. If the orcs are driven
        off, erase the crowds of refugees.</p>

        <h2>Updating the Campaign Map</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">The Campaign Map is updated between
        sessions or whenever the players spend significant downtime
        in a safe place. Updates are both prescriptive and
        descriptive: if an event transpires that, say, gathers a
        larger fighting force to a village, update the tags to
        reflect that. Likewise if a change in tags mean that a
        village has a bigger fighting force you'll likely see more
        armored men in the street.</p>

        <p>Between each session check each of the conditions below.
        Go down the list and check each condition for all steadings
        before moving to the next. If a condition applies, apply
        its effects.</p>

        <h4>Growth</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">When <strong>a village or town is
        Booming and its Prosperity is above Moderate</strong> you
        may reduce Prosperity and Defenses to move to the next
        largest type. New towns immediately gain Market and new
        cities immediately gain Guild (your choice).</p>

        <h4>Collapse</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">When <strong>a steading's Population is
        Exodus and its Prosperity is Poor or less</strong> it
        shrinks. A city becomes a town with a Steady Population and
        +Prosperity. A keep becomes a town with +Defenses and a
        Steady population. A town becomes a village with Steady
        population and +Prosperity. A village becomes a ghost
        town.</p>

        <h4>Want</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">When <strong>a steading has a Need that
        is not fulfilled</strong> (through trade, capture, or
        otherwise) that steading is in want. It gets either
        -Prosperity, -Population, or loses a tag based on that
        resource like Craft or Trade, your choice.</p>

        <h4>Trade</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">When <strong>Trade is blocked</strong>
        because the source of that trade is gone, the route is
        endangered, or political reasons, the steading has a
        choice: gain Need (a traded good) or take -Prosperity.</p>

        <h4>Capture</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">When <strong>control of a resource
        changes</strong> remove that resource from the tags of the
        previous owner and add it to the tags of the new owner (if
        applicable). If the previous owner has a Craft or Trade
        based on that resource they now have Need (that resource).
        If the new owner had a Need for that resource, remove
        it.</p>

        <h4>Profit</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">When <strong>a steading has more Trade
        than its current Prosperity</strong> it gets
        +Prosperity.</p>

        <h4>Surplus</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">When <strong>a steading has a Resource
        that another steading Needs</strong> unless Enmity or other
        diplomatic reasons prevent it they set up Trade. The
        steading with the Resource gets +Prosperity and their
        choice of Oaths, +Population, or +Defenses; the steading
        with the Need erases that need and adds Trade.</p>

        <h4>Aid</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">When <strong>a steading has Oaths to a
        steading under attack</strong> that steading may take
        -Defenses to give the steading under attack +Defenses.</p>

        <h4>Embattled</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">When <strong>a steading is surrounded
        by enemy forces</strong> it suffers loses. If it fights
        back with force it gets -Defenses. If its new Defenses are
        Watch or less it also gets -Prosperity. If it instead tries
        to wait out the attack it gets -Population. If its new
        Population is Shrinking or less it loses a tag of your
        choice. If the steading's Defenses outclass the attacker's
        (your call if it's not clear, or make it part of an
        Adventure Front) the steading is no longer surrounded.</p>

        <h4>Opportunity</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">When <strong>a steading has Enmity
        against a weaker steading</strong> they may attack.
        Subtract the distance (in rations) between the steadings
        from the steading with Enmity's Defenses. If the result is
        greater than the other steading's Defenses +Defense for
        each step of size difference (village to town, town to
        keep, keep to city) they definitely attack. Otherwise it's
        your call: has anything happened recently to stoke their
        anger? The forces of the attacker embattle the defender,
        while they maintain the attack they're -Defenses.</p>

        <h4>Clash</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">When <strong>two steadings both attack
        each other</strong> their forces meet somewhere between
        them and fight. If they're evenly matched they both get
        -Defenses and their troops return home. If one has the
        advantage they take -Defenses while the other takes -2
        Defenses.</p>

        <h3>Other Updates</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">The conditions above detail the most
        basic of interactions between steadings, of course the
        presence of your Fronts and the players mean things can get
        far more complex. Since tags are descriptive, add them as
        needed to reflect the players' actions and your fronts'
        effects on the world.</p>

        <h1>Hirelings</h1>

        <p class="NoIndent">Hirelings are those sorry souls
        that&mdash;for money, glory, or stranger
        needs&mdash;venture along with adventurers into the gloom
        and danger. They are the foolhardy that seek to make their
        name on adventures.</p>

        <p>Hirelings serve a few purposes. To the characters,
        they're the help. They lend their strength to the player
        characters' efforts in return for their pay. To the
        players, they're a resource. They buy the characters some
        extra time against even the most frightening of threats.
        They're also replacement characters, waiting to step up
        into the hero's role when a player character falls. To the
        GM, they're a human face for the characters to turn to,
        even in the depths of the earth of the far reaches of the
        planes.</p>

        <p>Hirelings are not heroes. A hireling may become a hero,
        as a replacement character, but until that time they're
        just another GM character, suffering the dangers and perils
        of the world. As such their exact HP, armor, and damage
        isn't particularly important. A hireling is defined by
        their <strong>Skill</strong> (or Skills) a
        <strong>Cost</strong> and a <strong>Loyalty</strong>
        score.</p>

        <p>A hireling's skill is a special benefit they provide to
        the players. Most skills are related to class abilities,
        allowing a hireling to fill in for a certain class. If you
        don't have a Ranger but you need to track the assassin's
        route out of Torsea anyway, you need a Tracker. Each skill
        has a rank, usually from 1 to 10. The higher the rank the
        more trained the hireling. Generally hirelings only work
        for adventurers of equal or higher level than their highest
        skill.</p>

        <p>If a hireling becomes a character their skills may
        suggest a given class, but there isn't a requirement. When
        the moment comes and the spotlight is on them they may find
        strength they didn't know they had.</p>

        <p>Skills don't limit what a hireling can do, they just
        provide mechanics for a certain ability. A hireling with
        the protector skill can still carry your burdens or check
        for traps, but the outcome isn't guaranteed by a rule. It
        will fall entirely to the circumstances and the GM. Sending
        a hireling to do something that is clearly beyond their
        abilities is asking the GM for trouble.</p>

        <p>Of course no hireling works for free. The hireling's
        cost is what it takes to keep them with the player
        characters. If the hireling's cost isn't paid regularly
        (usually once a session) they're liable to quit or turn on
        their employers.</p>

        <p>When hirelings are in play, the players may have to make
        the Order Hirelings move. The move uses the loyalty of the
        hireling that triggered the move:</p>

        <h3 class="MoveName">Order Hirelings</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">Hirelings do what you tell them to, so
        long as it isn't obviously dangerous, degrading, or stupid,
        and their cost is met. When a hireling find themselves in a
        dangerous, degrading, or just flat-out crazy situation due
        to your orders roll+loyalty. On a 10+ they stand firm and
        carry out the order. On a 7-9 they do it for now, but come
        back with serious demands later. Meet them or the hireling
        quits on the worst terms.</p>

        <h2>Making a Hireling</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Hirelings are easy to make on the fly.
        When someone enters the player's employ note down their
        name and what cost they've agreed to as well as any skills
        they may have.</p>

        <p>Start with a number based on where the hireling was
        found. Hirelings in villages start with 2&ndash;5. Town
        hirelings get 4&ndash;6. Keep hirelings are 5&ndash;8. City
        hirelings are 6&ndash;10. Distribute the hireling's number
        between loyalty, a main skill, and zero or more secondary
        skills. Starting loyalty higher than 2 is unusual, as is
        starting loyalty below 0. Choose a cost for the hireling
        and you're done.</p>

        <p>A hireling's stats, especially their loyalty, may change
        during play as a reflection of events. A particular
        kindness or bonus from the players is worth +1 loyalty
        forward. Disrespect is -1 loyalty forward. If it's been a
        while since their cost was last paid they get -1 loyalty
        ongoing until their cost is met. A hirelings loyalty may be
        permanently increased when they achieve some great deed
        with the players. A significant failure or beating may
        permanently lower the hireling's loyalty.</p>

        <h3>Costs</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>The Thrill of Victory</li>

          <li>Money</li>

          <li>Uncovered Knowledge</li>

          <li>Fame and Glory</li>

          <li>Debauchery</li>

          <li>Good Accomplished</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Skills</h3>

        <h4>Adept</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">An adept has at least apprenticed to an
        arcane expert, but is not powerful in their own right. They
        may have mastered a few simple spells, but they don't have
        anything like the wizard's spellbook</p>

        <p><em>Arcane Assistance</em>&mdash;When an adept aids in
        the casting of a spell of lower level than their skill, the
        spell's effects have greater range, duration, or potency.
        The exact effects depend on the situation and the spell and
        are up to the GM. The GM will describe what effects the
        assist will add before the spell is cast. The most
        important feature of casting with an adept is that any
        negative effects of the casting are focused on the adept
        first.</p>

        <h4>Expert</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">Experts are skilled in a variety of
        areas, most of them illicit or dangerous. They are good
        with devices and traps, but not too helpful in the field of
        battle.</p>

        <p><em>Experimental Trap Disarming</em>&mdash;When an
        expert leads the way they can detect traps almost in time.
        If a trap would be sprung while an expert is leading the
        way the expert suffers the full effects but the players get
        +skill against the trap and add the expert's skill to their
        armor against the trap. Most traps leave an expert in need
        of immediate healing. If the players Make Camp near the
        trap, the expert can disarm it by the time camp is
        broken.</p>

        <h4>Minstrel</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">When a smiling face is needed to smooth
        things over or negotiate a deal, a minstrel is always happy
        to lend their services for the proper price.</p>

        <p><em>A Hero's Welcome</em>&mdash;When you enter a place
        of food, drink, or entertainment with a minstrel you will
        be treated as a friend by everyone present (unless your
        actions prove otherwise). You also subtract the minstrel's
        skill from all prices in town.</p>

        <h4>Priest</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">Priest are the lower ranking clergy of
        a religion, performing minor offices and regular
        sacraments. While not granted spells themselves, they are
        able to call upon their deity for minor aid.</p>

        <p><em>Ministry</em>&mdash;When you make camp with a priest
        if you would normally heal you heal to your maximum HP
        value.</p>

        <p><em>First Aid</em>&mdash;When you call on a priest for
        healing, the priest rushes to your side and heals you of
        2&times;skill HP. You take -1 forward as their healing is
        painful and distracting.</p>

        <h4>Protector</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">A protector stands between their
        employer and the blades, fangs, teeth, and spells that
        would harm them.</p>

        <p><em>Sentry</em>&mdash;When a protector stands between
        you and an attack you increase your armor against that
        attack by the defender's skill, then reduce their skill by
        1 until they receive healing or have time to mend.</p>

        <p><em>Intervene</em>&mdash;When a protector helps you Defy
        Danger you may opt to take +1 from their aid. If you do you
        cannot get a 10+ result, a 10+ instead counts as a
        7&ndash;9.</p>

        <h4>Tracker</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">Trackers know the secrets of following
        a trail, but they don't have the experience with strange
        creatures and exotic locals that make for a great
        hunter.</p>

        <p><em>Track</em>&mdash;When a tracker is given time to
        study a trail while Making Camp, when camp is broken they
        can follow the trail to the next major change in terrain,
        travel, or weather.</p>

        <p><em>Guide</em>&mdash;When a tracker leads the way you
        automatically succeed on any Perilous Journey of a distance
        lower than the tracker's skill.</p>

        <h4>Warrior</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">Warriors are not masters of combat, but
        they are handy with a weapon. They won't be leading anyone
        into battle anytime soon, but their arm is good.</p>

        <p><em>Man-at-arms</em>&mdash;When you deal damage while a
        warrior aids you add their skill to the damage done. If
        your attack results in consequences (like a counter attack)
        the man-at-arms takes the brunt of it.</p>

      <h1>Monsters</h1>

      <div>
        <p class="NoIndent">Great heroes need horrendous
        antagonists. This section is about how to create and play
        as those antagonists&mdash;from the lowly goblin warrior to
        the hellish demon.</p>

        <h2>Using Monsters</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">A monster is any living (or undead)
        thing that stands in the players' way.</p>

        <p>How you use these monsters follows directly from your
        Agenda and Principles. Stay true to your principles, use
        your moves and pursue your agenda&mdash;you can't go
        wrong.</p>

        <p>Your first agenda is to "Make the world fantastic". This
        shines through strongly based on how you think about
        monsters. Everyone and everything who comes up against the
        players is a monster but that doesn't mean you have to
        write their stats out ahead of time. In a fantastic world,
        every goblin might end up in a fight but you don't have to
        know their HP before that happens. A monster is so simple
        to make you can jump right into the fiction, describing
        whatever you want and back it up with stats as you need
        them. Make the world fantastic: describe your monsters
        first and worry about their stats later.</p>

        <p>The player characters are the heroes. You shouldn't be
        rooting for the monsters, per se. Monsters exist to
        illustrate what a dangerous awful place Dungeon World can
        be&mdash;how it will remain if the players don't step in.
        If you feel like your monsters are being beaten too
        quickly, don't worry. Let the players revel in their
        victory and prepare a bigger, badder follow-up monster for
        next time.</p>

        <p>The principle of "Think dangerous" sums up that
        philosophy&mdash;the world is just as dangerous for the
        monsters as for the characters. An evil overlord doesn't
        care about his every golem, demon, and harpy. Until proven
        otherwise, consider every monster an arrow fired at the
        characters. The monsters are ammunition of the Danger
        you're presenting. Some may be smarter, faster, or more
        dangerous than others but until a monster warrants a name,
        a personality, or some other special consideration, it's an
        arrow. Take aim and shoot. Don't worry if you miss.</p>

        <p>A monster stops being an arrow when it is given a chance
        to shine by the players' actions. When the players are
        forced to run away from something it gains weight. When a
        monster somehow survives the players' assault it becomes
        interesting to the players and to the world at large. The
        players are the heroes. Your monsters are only important
        when they become important to the heroes and, thus,
        important to the world.</p>

        <p>One thing that your Agenda and Principles don't say
        anything about is setting up a fair fight. Heroes are often
        outnumbered or faced with ridiculous odds&mdash;sometimes
        they have to retreat and make a new plan. Sometimes they
        suffer loss. When adding a monster to a front, placing them
        in a dungeon, or making them up on the fly your first
        responsibility is to the fiction (Make the world fantastic)
        and to give the characters a real threat (Make the
        characters heroes), not to make a balanced fight. Dungeon
        World isn't about balancing encounter levels or counting
        experience points; it's about telling stories about
        adventure and death-defying feats!</p>

        <h2>Elements of a Monster</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">The most important part of a monster is
        what it does. These are it's <strong>moves</strong>. Just
        like the normal GM moves, they're things that you do when
        there's a lull in the action or when the players give you a
        golden opportunity. Just like the normal GM moves they can
        be hard or soft depending on the circumstances and the
        move: a move that's irreversible and immediate is hard, a
        move that's impending or mitigable is soft.</p>

        <p>Each monster's <em>raison d'&ecirc;tre</em> is summed up
        in its <strong>instinct</strong>. Much like Dangers,
        monsters have instincts that describe their goals at a high
        level. Some monsters live for conquest, or treasure, or
        simply for blood. The monster's instinct is the guide to
        how to use the monster</p>

        <p>The monster's <strong>description</strong> is where all
        its other features come from. The description is how you
        know what the monster really is, the other elements just
        reflect the description.</p>

        <p><strong>Damage</strong> is a measure of how much pain
        the monster can inflict at once. Just like player damage
        it's a dice to roll, maybe with some modifiers. A monster
        deals its damage to another monster or a player when it
        uses its standard weapons and tactics to hurt them, or when
        a move says so.</p>

        <p>Just like a weapon, monsters have <strong>tags</strong>
        that describe how it deals damage, including what range(s)
        it can do damage at. When trying to attack something out of
        its range (to close or too far) the monster's out of luck,
        no damage. Any tag that can go on a weapon (like Messy or
        Slow) can also go on a monster.</p>

        <p>There are also monster tags that apply only to monsters.
        These tags, listed below, describe the monster's key
        attributes. Every monster has a tag for its scope: where it
        falls in the bigger picture of Dungeon World. The scope tag
        lets the GM know how to portray the monster in a way that
        its stats back up, for example if an army of gnolls can
        take a defended village (hint: most likely). Some monsters
        also have a size tag, which notes their physical size.
        Monsters without a size tag are just about human size, give
        or take.</p>

        <p>A monster's <strong>HP</strong> is a measure of how much
        damage it can take before it dies. Just like players, when
        a monster takes damage it subtracts that amount from it's
        HP. At 0 HP it's dead, no Last Breath.</p>

        <p>Some monsters are lucky enough to enjoy
        <strong>Armor</strong>. Just like player armor: when a
        monster with armor takes damage it subtracts its armor from
        the damage done.</p>

        <p><strong>Special qualities</strong> describe innate
        aspects of the monster that are important to play. These
        are a guide to the fiction, and therefore the moves. There
        is no master list of special qualities, they're just
        plain-english descriptions of the qualities of a monster
        that aren't part of an attack. A quality like "Intangible"
        means just what it says: mundane stuff just passes through
        it. That means swinging a mundane sword at it isn't Hack
        and Slash, for a start.</p>

        <h3>Monsters Without Stats</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">Some creatures operate on a scale so
        far beyond the mortal that concepts like HP, Armor, and
        Damage just do not hold. These creatures may still cause
        problems for the players and may even be defeated with
        clever thinking and enough preparation, they just won't be
        trading blows.</p>

        <p>If a creature is of such a scale far beyond the players,
        or if it simply doesn't live or die like a mortal creature,
        don't assign it HP, Damage, or Armor. You can still use the
        monster creation rules to give it tags. The core of a
        stat-less monster is its instinct and moves; the GM can
        still make its moves and act according to its instinct.</p>

        <h2>Monster Tags</h2>

        <p><em>Magical</em>: It is by nature magical through and
        through.</p>

        <p><em>Devious</em>: Its main danger lies beyond the simple
        clash of battle.</p>

        <p><em>Gibbous</em>: Its anatomy and organs are bizarre and
        unnatural.</p>

        <p><em>Organized</em>: It has a group structure that aids
        it in survival. Defeating one may cause the wrath of
        others. One may sound an alarm.</p>

        <p><em>Intelligent</em>: Its smart enough that some
        individuals pick up other skills. The GM can adapt the
        monster by adding tags to reflect specific training, like a
        mage or warrior.</p>

        <p><em>Hoarder</em>: It almost certainly has treasure.</p>

        <p><em>Stealthy</em>: It can avoid detection and prefers to
        attack with the element of surprise.</p>

        <p><em>Terrifying</em>: Its presence and appearance evoke
        fear.</p>

        <p><em>Cautious</em>: It prizes survival over
        aggression.</p>

        <p><em>Construct</em>: It was made, not born</p>

        <p><em>Planar</em>: Its from beyond this world</p>

        <h3>Organization Tags</h3>

        <p><em>Horde</em>: Where there's one, theres more. A lot
        more.</p>

        <p><em>Group</em>: Usually seen in small numbers, 3&ndash;6
        or so.</p>

        <p><em>Solitary</em>: It lives and fights alone.</p>

        <h3>Size Tags</h3>

        <p><em>Tiny</em>: It's much smaller than a halfling.</p>

        <p><em>Small</em>: It's about halfling size.</p>

        <p><em>Large</em>: It's much bigger than a human, about as
        big as a cart.</p>

        <p><em>Huge</em>: It's as big as a small house or
        larger.</p>

        <h2>Making Monsters</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Monsters start with your description of
        them. No matter if you're making the monster before play or
        just as the players come face-to-face with it, a monster
        starts with a clear vision of what it is and what it
        does.</p>

        <p>If you're making a monster between sessions start by
        imagining it. Imagine what it looks like, what it does, why
        it stands out. Imagine the stories told about it and what
        effects it has had on the world.</p>

        <p>If you're making a monster on the fly during a session
        start by describing it to the players. Your description
        starts before the characters even lay eyes on it: describe
        where it lives, what marks it has made on the environment
        around it. Your description is the key to the monster.</p>

        <p>When you find you need stats for the monster you use
        this series of questions to establish them. Answer every
        question based on the facts established and imagined. Don't
        answer them aloud to anyone else, just note down the
        answers and the stats listed with each answer.</p>

        <p>If two questions would grant the same tag don't worry
        about it. If you like you can adjust damage or HP by 2 to
        reflect the tag that would be repeated, but it's not
        necessary. If a combination of answers would reduce HP or
        damage below 1 they stay at 1.</p>

        <p>When you're finished your monster may have only one
        move. If this is the case and you plan on using the monster
        often, give it another 2&ndash;3 moves of your choice.
        These moves often describe secondary modes of attack, other
        uses for a primary mode of attack, or connections to a
        certain place in the world.</p>

        <h4>What is it known to do?</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">Write a monster move describing what it
        does.</p>

        <h4>What does it want that causes problems for others?</h4>

        <h4>How does it usually hunt or fight?</h4>

        <ul>

          <li>Much larger than a cart: Huge, Reach, +8 HP, +3
          damage</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>What is its most important defense?</h4>

        </ul>

          <li>Deft strikes: +1 piercing</li>

          <li>Uncanny endurance: +4 HP</li>

          <li>Deceit and trickery: Stealthy, write a move about
          dirty tricks</li>

          <li>A useful adaptation like being amphibious or having
          wings: Add a special quality for the adaptation</li>

          <li>The favor of the gods: Divine, +2 damage or +2 HP or
          both (your call)</li>

          <li>Spells and magic: Magical, write a move about its
          spells</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>What is its most common form of attack?</h4>

        <p class="NoIndent">Note it along with the creature's
        damage. Common answers include: a type of weapon, claws, a
        specific spell. Then answer these questions about it.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Its armaments are vicious and obvious: +2 damage</li>

          <li>It lets the monster keep others at bay: Reach</li>

          <li>Its armaments are small and weak: -damage dice

        <h2>Treasure</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Monsters, much like adventurers,
        collect shiny useful things. When the players search the
        belongings of a monster (be they on their person or tucked
        away somewhere) describe them honestly.</p>

        <p>If the monster has accumulated some wealth you can roll
        that randomly. Start with the monster's damage die,
        modified if the monster is:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Hoarder: roll damage die twice, take higher
          result</li>

          <li>Far from home: +at least one ration (usable by anyone
          with similar taste)</li>

          <li>Magical: some strange item, possibly magical</li>

          <li>Divine: a sign of a deity (or deities)</li>

          <li>Planar: something not of this earth</li>

          <li>Lord over others: +1d4 to the roll</li>

          <li>Ancient and noteworthy: +1d4 to the roll</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="NoIndent">Roll the monster's damage die plus any
        added dice to fine the monster's treasure:</p>

        <ol>
          <li class="NumberedList">A few coins, 2d8 or so</li>

          <li class="NumberedList">An item useful to the current

        <h2>Monster Settings</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">The monsters in this book are presented
        in <strong>monster settings</strong>. A monster setting is
        a location (or type of location) and the monsters that
        inhabit it. It's a way of grouping monsters by where they
        fit in the world. A monster setting tells you what kind of
        monsters might inhabit an area while your Fronts tell you
        what monsters are working together or have ongoing
        plots.</p>

        <p>When creating your own monster settings, they can be
        more specific. You could create a monster setting for the
        Great Western Steppes or the Domains of the Horse
        Lords.</p>

        <p>Consult a monster setting to populate a Front or when
        you want a threat that is only tangentially related to one
        of your Fronts. For example, if the heroes are battling
        against the Dungeon Front "The Cult of Khul-ka-ra" by
        exploring the ancient ruins that the cult has made its home
        then you might use monsters from the Legions of the Undead
        as a related threat&mdash;not truly part of the front but
        still a block in the heroes' path.</p>

        <p>Monsters within a given setting will tend to be about as
        powerful. This is a product of their ecology&mdash;they're
        in competition for space and resources, after all. Cavern
        Dwellers or Denizens of the Murky Swamp are likely to be
        faced by fresh adventurers as they are the creatures who
        most often encroach on civilization. The Gnarled Woods,
        Ravenous Hordes, and Twisted Experiments settings hold more
        powerful monsters, monsters that can threaten the safety of
        whole cities. Planar Powers and Creatures of the Lower
        Depths are the most dangerous enemies the heroes can
        face&mdash;often endangering entire kingdoms. The Legions
        of the Undead are everywhere and can appear in just about
        any setting or situation.</p>

        <p>The monster stat blocks within these settings describe
        not only HP, damage, and all the other aspects of the
        monster, but also the reasons those stats were assigned.
        These monsters were created with the same process listed
        above, and the reasons for their stats are just as
        important as the stats themselves. Looking at the reasoning
        behind the stats will allow you to present the monsters
        honestly, answering questions that arise in Dungeon World
        like "can a warband of gnolls sack an entire village?"</p>

        <h3>Cavern Dwellers</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">At the edges of civilization in the
        caves and tunnels below the old mountains of the world
        dwell all sorts of scheming, dangerous monsters. Some are
        wily and old, like the race of goblins scheming to burn
        villages and make off with livestock. Others are strange
        aberrations of nature like the stinking, trash-eating
        Otyugh. A word of caution, then, to those brave adventurers
        whose first foray into danger leads them into these dank
        and shadowy places; bad things live in the dark. Bad things
        with sharp teeth.</p>

        <h3>Denizens of the Swamp</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">All things give way to rot, in the end.
        Food spoils on the table, men's minds go mad with age and
        disease. Even the world itself, when left untended and
        uncared for, can turn to black muck and stinking air.
        Things dwell in these parts of Dungeon World. Things gone
        just as a bad as the swirling filth that fills the swamps.
        In these cesspit lowlands adventurers will find such
        creatures as the deadly-eyed basilisk or the famed,
        unkillable troll. You'll need more than a dry pair of boots
        to survive these putrid fens. A sword would be a good
        start.</p>

        <h3>Legions of the Undead</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">The sermons of mannish and dwarven gods
        would tell you that Death is the end of all. They say that
        once the mortal coil is unwound and a person takes their
        final breath that all is warmth and song and the white
        wings of angels. Not so. Not for all. For some, after
        life's embrace loses its strength a darker power can take
        hold. Black magic rips the dead from the ground and gives
        them shambling unlife full of hate and hunger. Sorcery and
        witchcraft lend an ancient spell-smith the power to live
        forever in the husk of a Lich. There are bleak enchantments
        at play in shadowy corners all throughout Dungeon World.
        These creatures are the spawn of that fell magic.</p>

        <h3>The Dark Woods</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">It would not be a lie to say that there
        are trees that stand in the deepest groves of Dungeon World
        that have stood since before man or elf walked amidst their
        roots. It would be true, too, to say that these ancient
        trees have long lost the green leaves of spring. In the
        strands of the dark woods one finds, if one looks in the
        right place, sylvan monsters of old and powerful nature.
        Here live the race of savage Centaurs and the fey
        soul-stealing creatures of olde. Under the shadow of the
        ancient trees, wolf-men howl for blood. Hurry along the old
        forest road and light no fire for food or warmth for it's
        said that flames offend the woods themselves. You wouldn't
        want that, would you?</p>

        <h3>Ravenous Hordes</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">"I've bested an orc in single combat"
        they crow. "I've fought a gnoll and lived to the tell the
        tale." Which is no small feat and yet, you know the truth
        of these boasts. Like vermin, spotting but one of these
        creatures speaks to a greater doom on the horizon. No orc
        travels alone. No slavering gnoll moves without his pack.
        You know that soon, the wardrums will sound and the walls
        will be besieged by the full fury of the warchief and his
        tusked berserkers. These are the monsters that will bring
        civilization, screaming and weeping, to its knees. Unless
        you can stop them. Best of luck.</p>

        <h3>Twisted Experiments</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">For some who learn the arcane arts it's
        not merely enough to be able to live for a thousand years
        or throw lightning bolts that can fry a man. Some aren't
        quite satisfied with the power to speak to the dead or draw
        the angels down from heaven. Hubris calls on those
        cloaked-and-hooded "scientists" to make a strange and
        unholy life of their own. No mortal children, these. These
        are the wages of a mind gone foul with strange magic. In
        this setting you will find such nightmares as the chimera,
        dripping poison. Here, too, are the protector golems and
        mutant apes. All sorts of bad ideas await you in the fallen
        towers of the mad magicians of Dungeon World.</p>

        <h3>The Lower Depths</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">Ruins dot the countryside of Dungeon
        World. Old bastions of long-forgotten civilization fallen
        to decay, to monsters or to the whim of a vengeful god.
        These ruins often cover a much more dangerous truth &ndash;
        catacombs and underground complexes lousy with traps and
        monsters. Gold, too. Which is why you're here. Why you're
        locked in mortal combat with a tribe of spiteful dark
        elves. Battling stone giants in caverns the size of whole
        countries. Maybe, though, you're the noble souls who've
        travelled to the world's heart to put an end to the
        Apocalypse Dragon&mdash;the beast who, it is said, will one
        day swallow the sun and kill us all. We appreciate it,
        really. We'll all pray for you.</p>

        <h3>Planar Powers</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">Sometimes, monsters do not come from
        Dungeon World at all. Beyond the mountains at the edge of
        the world or below the deepest seas the sages and wise old
        priests say that there are gateways to the lands beyond.
        They speak of elysian fields; rivers of sweet wine and
        maidens dancing in fields of gold. They tell tales of the
        paradise of heavens to be found past the Planar Door. Tales
        tell, too, of the Thousandfold Hell. Of the swirling
        Elemental Vortex and the devils that wait for the stars to
        align so they can enter Dungeon World and wreak their
        bloody havoc. You must be curious to know if these tales
        are true? What will you see when the passage to the beyond
        is opened?</p>

        <p class="MonsterDescription">Most folk know that the
        undead feed on flesh. The warmth, blood and living tissue
        continue their unholy existence. This is true for most of
        the mindless dead, animated by black sorcery. Not so the
        Devourer. When a particularly wicked person (often a
        manipulator of men, an apostate priest or the like) dies in
        a gruesome way, the dark powers of Dungeon World might
        bring them back to a kind of life. The Devourer, however,
        does not feed on the flesh of men or elves. The Devourer
        eats souls. It kills with a pleasure only the sentient can
        enjoy and in the moments of its victims&rsquo; expiry,
        draws breath like a drowning man and swallows a soul. What
        does it mean to have your soul eaten by such a creature?
        None dare ask for fear of finding out. <em>Instinct</em>:

        the mighty fire of such a noble thing, the Dragonbone
        serves its master with a twisted devotion and is often set

        camp left their caves and the dark forests and built the
        First City to honor the gods. The others, a wild and savage
        lot, retreated into darkness. They grew, there. In the deep
        woods a grim loathing for their softer kin gave them
        strength. They found dark gods of their own, there in the
        woods and hills. Ages passed and they bred tall and strong
        and full of hate. We have forged steel and they match it
        with their savagery. We may have forgotten our common

        <p class="MonsterDescription">With good cause, they say
        that these creatures (like all insects, really) are claimed
        by the powers of Law. They are order made flesh&mdash;a
        perfectly stratified society in which every larva,
        hatchling and adult knows their place in the great hive.
        The Formian is some strange intersection of men and ants
        (though there are winged tribes that look like ants out in
        the Western Desert, I&rsquo;ve heard. And some with great
        sawtooth arms like mantids in the forests of the east).
        Tall, with a hard shell and a harder mind, these particular
        Formians are the bottom caste. They work the hills and
        honeycombs with single-minded joy that can be known only by

        These ant-folk are that whip. Lucky for them, with two
        extra arms, that&rsquo;s a lot of whip to crack. They
        oversee the vast swarms of worker drones that set to build
        the mighty caverns and ziggurats that dot the places that
        formians can be found. One in a hundred, these brutes stand
        two or three feet taller than their pale, near-mindless kin
        and have a sharper, crueler wit to match. They&rsquo;ll
        often ignore the soft races (as we&rsquo;re known) if we
        don&rsquo;t interfere in a project, but get in the way of

        carapace, often scarred with furrows and the ceremonial
        markings that set them apart from their drones, the formian
        centurions are their fighting force and rightly so. Born,
        bred and living only for the singular purpose to kill the
        enemies of their kind, they fight with one mind and a
        hundred swords. Thus far, the powers of Law have seen fit
        to spare mankind a great war with these creatures, but
        we&rsquo;ve seen them in skirmish&mdash;descending
        sometimes on border towns with their wings flickering in
        the heat or spilling up from a sandy mound to wipe clean a

        but it is known they can communicate with their children,
        somehow, over vast distances and that they begin to teach

        the fishermen of a coming tide, an inescapable swell of the
        power of some deep-sea god and that the triton empire would
        rise up and drag the land down into the ocean. The tale
        spread and now, when fishermen sail the choppy seas, they
        watch and worry that the dying triton&rsquo;s tales were

        <p class="MonsterDescription">There are a thousand forms of
        devil, maybe more. Some common and some unique. Each time
        the Inquisitors discover a new one they write it into the
        codex and the knowledge is shared among the abbeys in the
        hope that the atrocities of that particular sort
        won&rsquo;t find their way into the world again. The barbed
        devil has long been known to the brothers and sisters of
        the inquisition. A literal thing, it appears only at a site
        of great violence or when called by a wayward summoner.
        Covered in sharp quills, this particular demon revels in
        the spilling of blood, being specifically fond of impaling
        victims piecemeal or in whole upon its thorns and letting
        them die there. Cruel but not particularly effective beyond

        Appearing differently to each victim, this summoned
        creature has but a single purpose: to wrap its victim up in
        binding coils and take it away to a place of torment.
        Sometimes it will come as a man-shaped mass of rusting
        iron, hooks and coils of mismatched links. Other times, a

      <h1>Moves in Detail</h1>

      <div>
        <h3>Hack and Slash</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">Hack and Slash is for attacking a
        prepared enemy plain and simple. If the enemy isn't
        prepared for your attack&mdash;if they don't know you're
        there or they're restrained and helpless&mdash;then that's
        not Hack and Slash. You just deal your damage or murder
        them outright, depending on the situation. Nasty stuff.</p>

        <p>The enemy's counter-attack can be any GM move made
        directly with that creature. A goblin might just attack you
        back, or they might jam a poisoned needle into your veins.
        Life's tough, isn't it?</p>

        <p>Note that an "attack" is some action that a player
        undertakes that has a chance of causing physical harm to
        someone else. Attacking a dragon with inch-thick metal
        scales full of magical energy with a typical sword is like
        swinging a meat cleaver at a tank: it just isn't going to
        cause any harm, so it's not an attack. Note that
        circumstances can change that: if you're in a position to
        stab the dragon on it's soft underbelly (good luck with
        getting there) it could hurt, so it's an attack.</p>

        <p>If the action that triggers the move could reasonably
        hurt multiple targets roll once and apply damage to each
        target (they each get their armor).</p>

        <p class="Example">Jarl is up to his not-inconsiderable
        belly in slavering goblins. They have him surrounded,
        knives bared. "I've had enough of this!" he bellows "I
        wallop the closest goblin with my hammer." We agree that
        this is a combat situation and Jarl rolls the dice for Hack
        and Slash. He rolls an 11, so he has a choice. "Fear is for
        the weak! I deal extra damage&mdash;let the goblins come."
        "The goblin you strike certainly doesn't like that much" I
        say, "you smash your hammer into his shoulder and are
        rewarded with the crunch of goblin bones&mdash;and a deep
        knife wound as the goblin counter-attacks. He deals 4
        damage to you."</p>

        <p class="Example">Cadeus has the drop on two orc
        warriors&mdash;he's lurking in the shadows as the orcs walk
        past. "I leap out and bring my sword down in a sweeping
        arc, like this!" he says, miming the strike. The orc wasn't
        ready to fight so I say "The orc is caught entirely
        off-guard and doesn't even have a chance to raise his
        patchwork shield. Deal your damage." Cadeus rolls his
        damage and it's enough to kill the orc. The other warrior
        is still standing, so I say "The other orc freezes in
        horror for a split second. Then he's smiling at you with
        his horrible tusked mouth as he raises a signal horn from
        his belt. What do you do?"</p>

        <p class="Example">Bartelby has disarmed a duelist and has
        him at sword point. "I'm not giving this guy another chance
        to attack! I run him through." Without thinking about it
        carefully I say "Oh, okay, sounds like Hack and Slash,
        roll+Str." Bartelby rolls and gets a 7. I try to make a
        move "You run him through, he's not able to defend himself,
        but, uh&hellip; Oh, wait, he's not really in melee with
        you, is he? He's helpless. Forget Hack and Slash. You run
        him through and he slumps to the ground coughing up
        blood."</p>

        <h2>Volley</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Volley covers the entire act of
        drawing, aiming, and firing a ranged weapon or throwing a
        thrown weapon. The advantage to using a ranged weapon over
        melee is that the attacker is less likely to be attacked
        back. Of course they do have to worry about ammunition and
        getting a clear shot though.</p>

        <p>On a 7-9, read "danger" broadly. It can be bad footing
        or ending in the path of a sword or maybe just giving up
        your sweet sniper nest to your enemies. Whatever it is it's
        impending and it's always something that causes the GM to
        say "What do you do?" Quite often, the danger will be
        something that will then require you to dedicate yourself
        to avoiding it or force you to Defy Danger.</p>

        <p>If you're throwing something that doesn't have ammo
        (maybe you've got a move that makes your shield throwable)
        you can't choose to mark off ammo. Choose from the other
        two options instead.</p>

        <p class="Example">Aranwe is on the floor of the
        ritualarium as the orc eyegouger chants his ritual from
        atop the pedestal. "Since Thelian has the other orcs busy,
        I take the opportunity to site down my bow and take a shot
        at the orc running the ritual." "Sounds like volley to me."
        She rolls an 8, plus her Dex makes 9. "Looks like you have
        a tough choice" I say. "Well, I'm almost out of arrows, and
        we need to get rid of him before the ritual finishes, so
        I'm going to take the danger." "Sure, that sounds good.
        Well, as the ritual progresses the flames around him have
        gotten higher and you have to move around to take the shot.
        You hit him dead on, roll your damage, but you had to step
        inside the ritual circle to do it. Everything outside the
        circle looks cloudy and unreal, all you can hear is the orc
        chanting. Thelian, you notice that Aranwe is inside the
        circle. What do you do?"</p>

        <p class="Example">Halek is firing on the advancing kobold
        mob. He rolls an 8 and decides to be put in danger. I think
        for a moment and then say "You have to duck and dodge to
        get the shot but you finally let it go and nail the lead
        kobold. You hear something behind you and turn to see that
        you're right next to the ogre. He smashes you with his club
        and deals you 12 damage." "All that? Just for getting put
        in danger? That seems like a lot more than danger." He's
        right, of course, so I say "Oh, you're right&mdash;danger's
        something that's about to happen. How about, instead, you
        turn around after firing the shot and the ogre's right in
        your face! He's about to swing his club right down on you.
        What do you do?"</p>

        <h2>Defy Danger</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">You Defy Danger when you do something
        in the face of impending peril. This may seem like a
        catch-all. It is! Defy Danger is for those times when it
        seems like you clearly should be rolling but no other move
        applies.</p>

        <p>Defy Danger also applies when you make another move
        despite danger not covered by that move. For example, Hack
        and Slash assumes that's you're trading blows in
        battle&mdash;you don't need to Defy Danger because of the
        monster you're fighting unless there's some specific danger
        that wouldn't be part of your normal attack. On the other
        hand, if you're trying to Hack and Slash while spikes shoot
        from hidden traps in the walls, you're ignoring a clear and
        present threat and need to Defy Danger.</p>

        <p>Danger, here, is anything that requires resilience,
        concentration, or poise. This move will usually be called
        for by the GM. She'll tell you what the danger is as you
        make the move. Something like "You'll have to Defy Danger,
        first. The danger is the steep and icy floor you're running
        across. If you can keep your footing, you can make it to
        the door before the Necromancer's magic gets you."</p>

        <p>Which stat applies depends on what action you take and
        your action has to trigger the move. That means you can't
        Defy the Danger of the steep and icy floor with a charming
        smile just so you can use Cha, since charmingly smiling at
        the ice floor does nothing to it. On the other hand, making
        a huge leap over the ice would be Str, placing your feet
        carefully would be Dex, and so on. Make the move to get the
        results.</p>

        <p class="Example">Emory is climbing a steep ravine.
        Unbeknownst to him, a cultist sorcerer lurks nearby. The
        sorcerer casts a spell of frost on the cliffside, covering
        it with ice. "As you reach for the next handhold, a
        terrible chill overcomes you. If you want to keep climbing,
        Defy Danger or risk slipping" I say, making sure to explain
        what the Danger is. "No way" Emory says, "I need to get the
        top of this ravine! I grit my teeth and hold tight even as
        my fingers go numb." He rolls Defy Danger, getting an 8
        including his Con for enduring. Now it's time for a hard
        decision. "You make some progress but as your hands go numb
        you start slipping. The only way you can get any more
        traction is by jamming your dagger into the ice to pull
        yourself up the last few feet. If you do that, though, the
        dagger is going to be jammed in the face of the cliff until
        you get a chance to stop and pry it out."</p>

        <p class="Example">"The athach's third arm is swinging down
        on you with its crude club, what are you doing Valeria?"
        I've just made a move to establish an impending threat: the
        athach's strike. She says "I Hack and Slash it! I make a
        wide swing sideways, right into its legs." Sounds good to
        me, but she's not doing anything about the club coming at
        her. "Okay, you can do that, but you take the athach's
        damage from the club coming right down on your skull."
        "What? But trading blows is part of Hack and Slash, right?"
        "It is, but before you make your attack there's already a
        club coming at you, Hack and Slash doesn't cover that. Do
        you still want to Hack and Slash, or are you doing
        something about the club?"</p>

        <p class="Example">Octavia is locked in battle with an
        ogre. She says "I drop my shield and take up my hammer in
        both hands. I swing it at the ogre. That's Hack and Slash,
        right?" "Yeah, it will be but first you've gotta Defy
        Danger. The danger is the ogre's massive club." "Isn't that
        part of what Hack and Slash already is? I mean if he
        couldn't be smashing me with his club then I wouldn't be
        making the move at all because we wouldn't be in melee."
        "Oh yeah, you're totally right. Hack and Slash it is, make
        your roll!"</p>

        <h2>Defend</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Defending something means standing
        nearby and focusing on preventing attacks on that thing or
        stopping anyone from getting near it. When you're no longer
        nearby or you stop devoting your attention to incoming
        attacks then you lose any Hold you might have had.</p>

        <p>You can only spend Hold when someone makes an attack on
        you or the thing you're Defending. The choices you can make
        depend on the attacker and the type of attack. In
        particular, you can't deal damage to an attacker who you
        can't reach with your weapon.</p>

        <p>An attack is any action you can interfere with that has
        harmful effects. Swords and arrows are, of course, attacks
        but so are spells, grabs, and charges.</p>

        <p>If the attack doesn't deal damage then halving it means
        the attacker gets some of what they want but not all of it.
        It's up to you and the GM to work out what that means
        depending on the circumstances. If you're defending the Gem
        Eye of Oro-Uht and an orc tries to grab it from its
        pedestal then half effect might mean that the gem gets
        knocked to the floor but the orc doesn't get his hands on
        it, yet. Or maybe the orc gets ahold of it but so do
        you&mdash;now you're both fighting over it, tooth and nail.
        If you and the GM can't agree on a halved effect you can't
        choose that option.</p>

        <p>Defending yourself is certainly an option. It amounts to
        giving up on making attacks and just trying to keep
        yourself safe.</p>

        <p class="Example">Avon is weaving a powerful spell to send
        the source of the Necromancer's power back to the Plane of
        Death. The spell takes time and concentration and there's
        zombies massing on all sides! Lux says "While Avon's
        casting his spell, it's my duty to keep him alive. I stand
        between him and the dead and slam my hammer against my
        shield&mdash;'You want him, you go through me!' I'm
        Defending Avon." That sounds good to me, so I say
        "roll+Con." She gets an 11 and Holds three. A few moments
        later Avon finishes his spell but, in rolling for it, has
        to make a tough choice and puts himself in danger. I say
        "you unleash the magic of your spell, sure enough. The
        magical disturbance draws the attention of the zombie
        horde&mdash;they sense your power and it drives their
        hunger! With a sudden burst of speed, they're right on top
        of you. What do you do?" Avon looks unsure for a moment,
        but Lux says "Let them come. I've got his back. I'm
        spending a point of hold to direct that attack to me. I
        push Avon back and swing a wide arc with my shield. I'll
        also spend a point of hold to halve the damage. To be safe,
        I follow up with my hammer and use one more hold to deal
        damage to the gang of zombies." "Wow, okay. They get a few
        feeble claws past your guard but you're mostly unscathed.
        That does it for your hold. Are you still defending him or
        are you doing something else?" "I don't think he'll live
        long without me. I yell at him to run without taking my
        eyes off the zombies, I'm not letting any of them past me."
        "Sounds like you're Defending again, roll+Con."</p>

        <p class="Example">Hadrian has been Defending Durga while
        she heals a badly wounded Willem. Willem's in fighting
        shape again so Durga has leaped forwards to drive back the
        troglodytes. Hadrian is still locked in battle with a
        deadly crocodilian. The troglodytes attack Durga and
        Hadrian reacts. "Wait! I still have one hold to Defend
        Durga. I'm doing to redirect that attack to myself." That
        doesn't sound quite right to me, they're spread out, now.
        "How are you doing that if she's over at the troglodyte
        camp and you're battling the crocodilian in the water?" "Oh
        yeah. I guess when I started doing something other than
        standing guard I lost that hold. Damn."</p>

        <h2>Spout Lore</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">You Spout Lore any time you want to
        search your memory for knowledge or facts about something.
        You take a moment to ponder the things you know about the
        Orcish Tribes or the Tower of Ul'dammar and then reveal
        that knowledge.</p>

        <p>The knowledge you get is like consulting a bestiary,
        travel guide, or library. You get facts about the subject
        matter. On a 10+ those facts the GM will show you how those
        facts can be immediately useful, on a 7&ndash;9 they're
        just facts.</p>

        <p>On a miss the GM's move will often have to do with the
        time you take thinking. Maybe you miss that goblin moving
        around behind you, or the trip wire across the hallway.
        It's also a great chance to reveal an unwelcome truth.</p>

        <p>Just in case it isn't clear: the answers are always
        true, even if the GM had to make them up on the spot.
        Always say what honesty demands.</p>

        <p class="Example">Fenfaril has had the misfortune of
        dropping through an illusory floor and now finds himself in
        a murky pit. A mottled, eyeless creature shambles towards
        him, mumbling in a strange tongue. "I'm a little freaked
        out&mdash;what is this thing? Is it going to attack me? I
        probably read about these things in a bestiary back in
        school." "Great, that's Spout Lore." I say. Fenfaril rolls
        and gets an 8. "Well of course you read about these. The
        name escapes you, but you clearly remember a drawing of a
        creature like this standing in front of a doorway, like a
        guard, with someone kneeling before it." On a strong hit I
        would have given some information on what makes the
        creature let people pass.</p>

        <p class="Example">Vitus has Spouted Lore on a gilded skull
        she found on a pedestal and gotten a 10. I begin by saying,
        mysteriously, "You're pretty sure you recognize the
        telltale signs of metal forged in the City of Dis, the
        living planar city." I catch myself and remember to be
        generous with the truth and make it useful. I add "You
        recognize some of the glyphs from your spellbook, actually:
        they're part of fire spells, but with other magic symbols
        smaller inside them. Casting a non-fire spell into the
        skull turns it into fire magic, based on the glyphs."</p>

        <h2>Discern Realities</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">To Discern Realities you must closely
        observe your target. That usually means interacting with it
        or watching someone else do the same. You can't just stick
        your head in the doorway and Discern Realities about a
        room. You're not merely scanning for clues&mdash;you have
        to look under and around things, tap the walls and check
        for weird dust patterns on the bookshelves. That sort of
        thing.</p>

        <p>Discerning Realities isn't just about noticing a detail,
        it's about figuring out the bigger picture. The GM always
        describes what the player characters experience honestly,
        so during a fight the GM will say that the kobold mage
        stays at the other end of the hall. Discerning Realities
        could reveal the reason behind that: the kobold's motions
        reveal that he's actually pulling energy from the room
        behind him, he can't come any close.</p>

        <p>Just like Spout Lore the answers you get are always
        honest ones. Even if the GM has to figure it out on the
        spot. Once they answer, it's set in stone. You'll want to
        Discern Realities to find the truth behind
        illusions&mdash;magical or otherwise.</p>

        <p>Unless a move says otherwise players can only ask
        questions from the list. If a player asks a question not on
        the list the GM can tell them to try again or answer a
        question from the list that seems equivalent.</p>

        <p>Of course, some questions might have a negative answer,
        that's fine. If there really, honestly is nothing useful or
        valuable here, the GM will answer that question with
        "Nothing, sorry."</p>

        <p class="Example">Finding a strangely empty room guarded
        by deadly traps, Omar says "I don't trust this shifty room.
        I'm going to poke around a little. I take out my tools and
        start messing with stuff&mdash;pulling candlesticks,
        tapping the wall with my stone hammer. My usual tricks." I
        say to Omar, "Sounds like you're Discerning Realities?"
        Omar answers in the affirmative and makes his roll. He
        rolls a 12 and gets to ask questions. "What here is not as
        it appears to be?" I think for a second, look at my notes
        and tell him, "As you tap the walls you find that there's
        an odd, hollow space on the north side. The stones look
        newer too, this was added recently. It's actually a hidden
        room."</p>

        <p class="Example">Omar still has two more questions. His
        his next one is "Who sealed the hidden room?" That's not a
        question from the list but it sounds to me like he's really
        asking "what happened here recently". I answer that
        instead. "Looking at the stonework you notice the wall
        bends out a little. The work's definitely of goblin
        origin&mdash;shoddy and quick. The only way it could get
        bent out like that is if something pushed out on the stones
        from within." "So some goblins blocked it from the other
        side?" Omar says. "Yeah, exactly."</p>

        <h2>Parley</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Parley covers a lot of ground including
        old standbys like intimidation and diplomacy. You know
        you're using Parley when you're trying to get someone to do
        something for you by holding a promise or threat over them.
        Nice or not, the tone doesn't matter.</p>

        <p>Merely asking someone politely isn't Parleying. That's
        just talking. You say "Can I have that magic sword?" and
        the King's knight says "Hell no, this is my blade, my
        father forged it and my mother enchanted it" and that's
        that. To Parley, you have to have leverage. Leverage is
        anything that could lure the target of your Parley to do
        something for you. Maybe it's something they want or
        something they don't want you to do. Like a sack of gold.
        Or punching them in the face. What counts as leverage
        depends on the people involved and the request being made.
        Threaten a long goblin with death and you have leverage.
        Threaten a goblin backed up by his gang with death and he
        might think he's better off in a fight.</p>

        <p>On a hit they ask you for something related to whatever
        leverage you have. If your leverage is that you're standing
        before them sharpening your knife and insinuating about how
        much you'd like to shank them with it they might ask you to
        let them go. If your leverage is your position in court
        above them they might ask for a favor.</p>

        <p>Whatever they ask for, on a 10+, you just have to
        promise it clearly and unambiguously. On a 7&ndash;9,
        that's not enough: you also have to give them some
        assurance, right now, before they do what you want. If you
        promise that you'll ensure their safety from the wolves if
        they do what you want and you roll a 7-9 they won't do
        their part until you bring a fresh wolf pelt, for example.
        It's worth noting that on a 10+ you don't actually have to
        keep your promise. Whether you'll follow up or not, well,
        that's up to you. Of course breaking promises leads to
        problems. People don't take kindly to oath-breakers and
        aren't likely to deal with them in the future.</p>

        <p>In some cases when you state what you want you may
        include a possible promise for the creature to make, as in
        "Flee and I'll let you live." It's up to the target of the
        Parley if that's the promise they want or if they have
        something else in mind. They can say "yes, let me live and
        I'll go" (with assurances, if you rolled a 7&ndash;9) or
        "promise me you won't follow me."</p>

        <p class="Example">Leena is trying to convince Lord Hywn to
        vouch for her so that she is granted an audience with the
        Queen. She's laid out what she wants pretty well but I say
        "Lord Hywn obviously isn't convinced. Why should he help
        you?" She smirks a bit. "Oh. That. While I'm talking to
        him, I absentmindedly start playing with the signet ring
        from that assassin we killed. The one he hired to off the
        prince. I make a big show of it just to make sure he sees
        who's ring it is." That's perfect; now I know what to ask
        for. Leena's player hits her roll with an 8. "Once your
        little show sets in, Hywn just looks at you coldly. After a
        moment he says 'Enough being coy. You and I both know you
        murdered my hired man. Give me that ring and swear you'll
        speak no more about it, then I'll do as you ask." "Oh sure,
        I give it to him" she says "We can always dig up more dirt
        on this scumbag later."</p>

        <p class="Example">Pendrell's trying to get into the
        gambling den where One-Eye usually plays. He saunters up to
        the guards and says "Hey fellas, how's it going, care to
        open the door for me?" Pendrell's player says "I'm being
        all suave as I do it to; really cool so these guys will let
        me in. That's Parley! I roll+Cha." Something's not right
        here so I stop him "Wait a sec. All you've done is tell
        these guys what you want&mdash;you're just talking. The big
        smelly one on the right of the door steps in front of you,
        looks you in the eyes and says 'Sorry, private venue' like
        he's bored with keeping people out and he'd rather be
        inside himself. If you want to Parley him, you need some
        leverage. A bribe maybe?"</p>

        <h2>Aid or Interfere</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Any time you feel like two players
        should be rolling against each other, the defender should
        be Interfering with the attacker. This doesn't always mean
        sabotaging them. It can mean anything from arguing against
        a Parley to just being a shifty person who's hard to
        Discern. It's about getting in the way of another players'
        success.</p>

        <p>Always ask the person aiding or interfering how they are
        doing it. As long as they can answer that, they trigger the
        move. Sometimes, as the GM, you'll have to ask if
        interference is happening. Your players might not always
        notice they're interfering with each other.</p>

        <p>Aid is a little more obvious. If a player can explain
        how they're helping in a roll and it makes sense, let them
        roll to aid.</p>

        <p>No matter how many people aid or interfere with a given
        roll, the target only gets the +1 or -2 once. Even if a
        whole party of adventurers aid in attacking an ogre, the
        one who makes the final attack only gets +1.</p>

        <p class="Example">Ozruk stands alone and bloodied before a
        pack of angry hellhounds. Behind him, the Prince of Lescia
        weeps in fear. Ozruk says "I stand firm and lift my shield,
        despite certain doom. I'm defending the Prince." At the
        last moment, though (just as I'm about to have Ozruk roll
        Defend) Aronwe appears from the shadows, sword drawn. "Doom
        is not so certain, Dwarf" he says. "I'm standing beside
        him, helping Ozruk Defend by covering his sword arm."
        Aronwe rolls+bonds and, if he succeeds, Ozruk will be able
        to add a +1 to his Defend result.</p>

        <h1>Special Moves</h1>

        <p class="NoIndent">Special moves are moves that come up
        less often or in more specific situations. They're still
        the basis of what characters do in Dungeon
        World&mdash;particularly what they do between dungeon
        crawls and high-flying adventures.</p>

        <h2>Last Breath</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">The Last Breath is the last moment that
        stands between life and death. Time stands still as Death
        comes to claim the living. Even those who stay will catch a
        glimpse of the other side as they fight for their life.
        Many are changed by this moment&mdash;even those who escape
        alive.</p>

        <p>The deal offered by death is decided by the GM but it
        should always be a real choice with real consequences. If
        the GM offers something completely painless, the move is
        pointless. If the GM offers a ridiculous price, no one will
        take it. Think of ways that the character might be changed
        by the event: a new goal in life, a debt that must be paid,
        an obligation.</p>

        <p class="Example">Sparrow stands at Death's black gates.
        First the Gm describes what she sees beyond them: "In among
        the suffering souls you clearly see Lord Hywn. It appears
        his double dealing has caught up with him." Now for the
        bargain: "The shadowy form of Death itself steps between
        you and the gates. 'Here so soon? I enjoy seeing the souls
        you send me. I'll return you to the world so that you may
        serve me, but there is a cost: you will never be able to
        move under the sun again, or you will return to my realm
        immediately."</p>

        <h2>Encumbrance</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">A PC's Load stat is determined by their
        class and Str. Being able to carry more is a clear benefit
        when trying to carry treasure out of a dungeon or just
        making sure you can bring along what you need.</p>

        <p>This move only applies to things a person could walk
        around and still act with. Carrying a boulder on your back
        is not encumbrance&mdash;you can't really act or move much
        with it. It effects what moves you can make appropriately
        in the fiction.</p>

        <h2>Carouse</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Unless the PCs are particularly
        extravagant or generous Carousing doesn't cost any gold. If
        the players are paying someone else's tab or living the
        high life then it'll costs them appropriately.</p>

        <p>You can only carouse when you return triumphant. That's
        what draws the crowd of revelers to surround adventurers as
        they celebrate their latest haul. If you don't claim your
        success or your failure is well known then who would want
        to party with you anyway?</p>

        <h2>Undertake a Perilous Journey</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Distances in Dungeon World are measured
        in rations. A ration is the amount of supplies used up in a
        day. Journeys take more rations when they are long or when
        travel is slow.</p>

        <p>A perilous journey is the whole way between two
        locations. You don't roll for one day's journey and then
        make camp only to roll for the next day's journey, too.
        Make one roll for the entire trip.</p>

        <p>This move only applies when you know where you're going.
        Setting off to explore is not a perilous journey. It's
        wandering around looking for cool things to discover. Use
        up rations as you camp and the GM will give you details
        about the world as you discover them.</p>

        <h2>Make Camp</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">You usually Make Camp so that you can
        do other things, like Prepare Spells or Dutiful Prayer. Or,
        you know, sleep soundly at night. Whenever you stop to
        catch your breath for more than an hour or so, you've
        probably Made Camp.</p>

        <p>When camping in dangerous territory the selections made
        apply to the entire camp. Every PC camping out needs to
        roll. Camping with fewer than three characters, or without
        the Ranger, is dangerous&mdash;there will always be at
        least one option not selected.</p>

        <p>What counts as dangerous territory is up to the GM. She
        should call for the move. When not Making Camp in dangerous
        territory the camp is in all ways unexceptional with
        neither benefits or dangers.</p>

        <p>Staying a night in an inn or house is Making Camp is a
        safe location. Regain your hit points as usual, but only
        mark off a ration if you're eating from the food you carry,
        not paying for a meal or receiving hospitality.</p>

        <h2>Outstanding Warrants</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">This move is only for places where
        you've caused trouble, not every piece of civilization you
        enter. Being publicly caught up in someone else's trouble
        still triggers this move.</p>

        <p>Civilization generally means the villages, towns and
        cities of humans, elves, dwarves, and halflings but it can
        also apply to any relatively lawful establishment of
        monstrous species, such as orcs or goblins. If the PCs have
        stayed there as part of the community it's
        civilization.</p>

      <h1>Moves in Detail</h1>

      <div>
        <h1>Multiclass Moves</h1>

        <h2>Multiclass Dabbler</h2>

        <h2>Multiclass Initiate</h2>

        <h2>Multiclass Master</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">For the purposes of these multiclass
        moves the Cleric's Commune and Cast a Spell count as one
        move. Likewise for the Wizard's Spellbook, Prepare Spells,
        and Cast a Spell.</p>

        <p>If a multiclass move grants you the ability to cast
        spells you prepare and cast spells as if you had one level
        in the casting class. Whenever you level up you increase
        the level you prepare and cast spells at too.</p>

        <p class="Example">When Ajax gains 3rd level he takes
        Multiclass Dabbler to get Commune and Cast a Spell from the
        Cleric class. He casts and prepares spells like a first
        level Cleric: first level spells and rotes only, a total of
        2 levels of spells prepared.</p>

        <h1>Bard Moves</h1>

        <h2>Bardic Lore</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Treat the areas of your lore like
        books. Is the upwards-flowing waterfall you just came
        across something important that would be covered in a book
        called "On Spells and Magicks?" If so, your Bardic Lore
        applies.</p>

        <p>If you care enough to ask a question about it then it's
        probably important. Don't second guess yourself: if you
        care enough to want to know more about it then it has some
        importance.</p>

        <h2>Charming and Open</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Speaking frankly means you really are
        being open with them, not just giving the appearance of
        openness. It's your true sincerity that puts others at ease
        and lets you get information out of them; if you're trying
        to maintain a lie at the same time you won't get very
        far.</p>

        <h2>It Goes To Eleven</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Of course the creature you effect must
        have some way of harming your target of choice. Spurring a
        wolf into a frenzy to attack the eagle lord circling above
        doesn't do any good, the wolf doesn't have a way to attack
        it.</p>

        <h2>An Ear for Magic</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Acting on the answers can mean acting
        against them or taking advantage of them. Either way you
        take +1 forward.</p>

        <h1>Cleric</h1>

        <h2>Commune</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">If you like you can prepare the same
        spell more than once.</p>

        <h1>Cleric Spells</h1>

        <h2>Guidance</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">It's up the the creativity of your
        deity (and the GM) to communicate as much as possible
        through the motions and gestures of you deity's symbol. You
        don't get visions or a voice from heaven, just some visual
        cue of what your deity would have you do (even if it's not
        in your best interest).</p>

        <h2>Magic Weapon</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Casting Magic Weapon on the same weapon
        again has no effect. No matter how many times you cast it
        on the same weapon it's still just magic +1d4 damage.</p>

        <p>Magic though is nothing to be scoffed at. Having a magic
        weapon may give you an advantage against some of the
        stranger beasts of Dungeon World, ghosts and the sort. The
        exact effects depend on the monster and circumstances, so
        make the most of it.</p>

        <h2>Animate Dead</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Treating the zombie as your character
        means you make moves with it's ability scores based on the
        fiction, just like always. Unless it's brain is functioning
        on its own the zombie can't do much besides follow the last
        order it was given, so you'd better stay close. Even if its
        brain works it's still bound to follow your orders.</p>

        <h1>Fighter Moves</h1>

        <h2>Signature Weapon</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">The base description you choose is just
        a description. Choosing a spear doesn't give you Close
        range, for example. You could choose a spear as the
        description, then Hand as the range. Your spear is
        something special, or your technique with it is different,
        just describe why your weapon has the tags you've
        chosen.</p>

        <h2>Heirloom</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">The exact nature of the spirits (and
        therefore what knowledge they can offer to you) is up to
        you and the GM to decide. Maybe they're dead ancestors, or
        echoes of people you've slain, or a minor demon. Up to
        you.</p>

        <h2>Armor Mastery</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Armor and shields that are reduced to 0
        armor are effectively destroyed. You'll pretty much be
        paying for a new one anyway, so you might as well drop them
        and haul out some gold instead.</p>

        <h1>Paladin Moves</h1>

        <h2>Evidence of Faith</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Your +1 forward applies to anything you
        do based on your knowledge of the spell's effects: defying
        it, defending against it, using it to your advantage,
        etc.</p>

        <h1>Ranger Moves</h1>

        <h2>Command</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Your bonuses only applies when your
        animal is doing something it's trained in. An animal not
        trained to attack monsters won't be any help when you're
        attacking a otyugh.</p>

        <h1>Thief Moves</h1>

        <h2>Backstab</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Reducing armor until they repair it
        means that they lose armor until they do something that
        compensates for your damage. If you're fighting an armored
        knight that might mean a fresh suit of armor, but for a
        thick-hided ogre its until they've had time to heal up (or
        protect the wound you left).</p>

        <h2>Poisoner</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">In order to make more doses of your
        chosen poison you need to be reasonably able to gather the
        required materials. If you're locked up at the top of a
        tower you're not going to be able to get the materials you
        need of course.</p>

        <h2>Wealth and Taste</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">In order to use this move it's really
        got to be your most valuable possession. It's the honest
        value you place on it that draws others, no lies.</p>

        <h2>Disguise</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Your disguise covers your appearance
        and any basics like accents and limps. It doesn't grant you
        any special knowledge of the target, so if someone asks you
        what your favorite color is you'd better think fast.
        Defying Danger with Cha is a common part of maintaining a
        Disguise.</p>

        <h1>Wizard Moves</h1>

        <h2>Prepare Spells</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">You can prepare the same spell twice if
        you like.</p>

        <h2>Empowered Magic</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Maximizing the effects of a spell is
        simple for spells that involve a roll: a maximized Magic
        Missile does 8 damage. In other cases it's down to the
        circumstances. A maximized Identify might result in far
        more information than expected. If there's no clear way to
        maximize it you can't choose that option.</p>

        <p>Likewise for doubling the targets. If the spell doesn't
        have targets you can't choose to double them.</p>

        <h1>Wizard Spells</h1>

        <h2>Dispel Magic</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">The exact effects depend on the
        circumstances. A goblin orkaster's spell might just be
        ended; a deity's consecration is probably just dimmed. The
        GM will tell you the likely effects of Dispeling a given
        effect before you cast.</p>

        <h2>Fireball</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">"Nearby" means a few paces at most,
        depending on the circumstances.</p>

        <h2>Polymorph</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">In some cases the GM may choose the
        last option more than once to list each unexpected benefit
        or weakness.</p>

        <h2>Summon Monster</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">The exact type of monster you get is up
        to the GM, based on your choices. If you want a
        non-reckless swimming creature you might get a water
        elemental, a 1d8 damage +2 Str creature might be a barbed
        devil. Whatever the creature is you still get to play
        it.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div xmlns:aid="http://ns.adobe.com/AdobeInDesign/4.0/">
      <h1>Making Moves</h1>

      <div>
        <p class="NoIndent">At some point you'll likely want to
        make your own moves. You might want to create moves to
        reflect some particular threat ("When you go alone into the
        Unhallowed Halls&hellip;"). You might create moves to cover
        something that's particularly important to you setting
        ("When you swim in the dark waters&hellip;"). You might
        create moves to expand a class, or create your own class
        entirely.</p>

        <p>This chapter covers how to create moves and more
        importantly why to create moves.</p>

        <p>Moves are the simplest way to modify the game, but you
        can go beyond that. Maybe you have a cool idea for an
        entire class, or you want to change how monsters work, or
        even mess with the entire GMing structure. Well get to
        those topics too, but first: moves.</p>

        <h2>Starting Points</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Where do moves come from?</p>

        <p>You can start a move with the trigger. Some actions will
        just feel like they should be a move. This is the most
        common starting point for moves. You'll see some action
        coming up and feel like it's different enough from existing
        moves that it needs its own rules.</p>

        <p>You can start with the effect. This is particularly
        useful for class moves. You know that casting a spell is
        something that the Wizard does, so what triggers that
        effect?</p>

        <p>Rarely, you can even start with the mechanics. Sometimes
        you'll think of something cool, like a tamed demon who's
        happiness is a constantly varying stat, and go from there.
        Be wary of any idea that's entirely mechanical. Since moves
        always start and end with the fiction, a mechanical idea is
        the least important bit of the move.</p>

        <p>A final starting point is someone else's move. Between
        Apocalypse World, Dungeon World, Monsterhearts, and the
        dozens of other games using moves there are many great
        ideas out there. If you plan to use a borrowed move for
        anything beyond your personal gaming group, its a good idea
        to ask the author first. They're usually pretty cool about
        it.</p>

        <h2>Types of Moves</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">What role the move is fulfilling
        determines what kind of move you're creating.</p>

        <p>Moves for dealing with the environment or special
        features you've added to Dungeon World are special moves.
        These moves are usually the GMs domain, a place to make
        parts of the world stand out. Since moves are always
        triggered by the players most moves like this should be
        written or printed somewhere everyone can look them over
        unless the move covers something that the player characters
        wouldn't have any idea about.</p>

        <p>Moves that reflect some special competency or power, or
        something the players do, are usually class moves. If the
        move is clearly tied to a specific class, add it to that
        class. If the move is tied to some concept that multiple
        classes might have access to, like a move only accessible
        to those that have seen beyond Death's Black Gates, you can
        create a Compendium Class for those moves. A Compendium
        Class is like a mini-class, it's a collection of moves
        around a fictional theme. We'll deal with them in more
        detail later.</p>

        <p>If your move is something the players do but isn't
        associated with any specific theme or class it's probably a
        basic of special move. If it comes up all the time it's a
        basic move, if it comes up more rarely it's a special
        move.</p>

        <p>Moves made by the players in response to monsters, such
        as the effects of a disease or pressing on despite a
        focused blast of wind from an air elemental, are player
        moves associated with that monster. Player moves associated
        with a monster are fairly rare, most of the ways a player
        will interact with a monster are covered by the basic and
        class moves.</p>

        <p>Moves made by monsters against the players aren't player
        moves at all. They're monster moves, simple statements of
        what the monster does. Trying to make every monster move
        into a player move will seriously hamper your
        creativity.</p>

        <h2>World Moves</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Your Dungeon World is full of fantastic
        things, right? You're likely to find that some of those
        fantastic things deserve or demand custom moves to reflect
        exactly what they do. Consider this one from Chris
        Bennet:</p>

        <p class="Example">When you open a sewer hatch roll+Str. On
        a 10+, choose 3. On a 7-9 choose 1.</p>

        <ul>
          <li class="Exampleli">You avoid being covered in feces
          and rotting animal entrails from the sewers above.</li>

          <li class="Exampleli">You avoid having a gelatinous cube
          land on you.</li>

          <li class="Exampleli">You find a secret back entrance to
          where the merchant's daughter is being held.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This move is strong because it is tied strongly to a
        particular place at a particular time. This move was
        written by request for Jason Morningstar's Dungeon World
        game as the players entered some particularly horrible
        sewers to find a powerful merchant's daughter. Two of the
        options here are very directly tied to that precise
        situation.</p>

        <p>Why would you write this move instead of just using Defy
        Danger? You wouldn't, always. Opening a pressurized sewer
        hatch is certainly dangerous, you could use Defy Danger.
        This move does have the advantage of setting up the choices
        ahead of time. This is actually a very strong technique: if
        there's a particular situation that is likely to cause Defy
        Danger, you can write a custom move that describes the
        tough choice to be made to save the GM some thinking in the
        moment.</p>

        <p>The other strength of moves like this is they call out
        something as important. By making the trigger "when you
        open a sewer hatch" instead of "when you act despite an
        imminent threat" the move calls out that these sewers are
        always dangerous.</p>

        <h2>Class Moves</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Each class has enough moves to take it
        through tenth level but that doesn't mean you can't add
        more. Adding moves to a class can demonstrate your idea of
        Dungeon World. Take this one, for example:</p>

        <p class="Example">When you claim a room for you deity,
        mark every entrance and roll+Wis. On a 10+ the room is
        peacebonded: no one can take action to cause physical harm
        within it. On a 7&ndash;9 the room is peacebonded, but the
        show of divine power draws attention. You can dismiss the
        peacebond as you see fit.</p>

        <p>This move presents a slightly different side of Dungeon
        World, one that can demand peace (something that usually
        doesn't come easily to PCs). This may not be every Dungeon
        World game, but it's a great way to show how your Dungeon
        World looks reflected in the characters.</p>

        <p>When adding a move, look carefully at what class it
        belongs to. Avoid giving a class moves with infringe on
        another class's areas of expertise. If the Thief can cast
        spells just as well as the Wizard the Wizard is likely to
        feel marginalized. This is why the multiclass moves act as
        one level lower, so that each class's niche is somewhat
        protected.</p>

        <p>Be careful with any move that provides the same benefit
        as an existing move even if the trigger is different.
        +damage moves in particular should be avoided for the most
        part unless carefully crafted with interesting triggers.
        +armor too can be problematic if given too freely. The
        classes at present have damage and armor increases the
        reflect the overall danger of Dungeon World, giving them
        more can negate potential threats.</p>

        <h2>New Classes</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Creating a new class is more than just
        writing some new moves. Your first consideration should be
        how the class relates to the existing classes. No character
        exists in isolation, so you should think carefully about
        why this class is different.</p>

        <p>An excellent first step to creating a new class is to
        think about what fictional characters you'd like to task an
        inspiration. Don't slavishly follow what that fictional
        character can do (after all, they weren't in Dungeon World)
        but use them as a guide for what's cool about being that
        person.</p>

        <p>The inspirations for the classes in this book are fairly
        clear, and made clearer by the notes in the margins. Note
        that not every inspiration is taken entirely: the wizards
        of Discworld inspired slightly pompous style of the Wizard,
        but the Wizard is far more competent and casts spells
        differently than the typical Discworld character. The
        inspiration is one of style, not an attempt to recreate
        what a certain character could do in a certain book.</p>

        <p>With a clear idea in mind you have a few basic steps
        that aren't a concern when writing single moves: HP, Bonds,
        Look, equipment, alignment, races.</p>

        <p>A class's HP is usually some base+Constitution. Base HP
        is almost always 4, 6, 8, or 10. Having more HP than the
        Fighter and Paladin might make those classes obsolete
        unless you're careful. Having less HP than the Wizard is
        probably character suicide. 4 base HP makes for a class
        that is deliberately fragile, they'll need help from others
        when the swords come out. 6 base HP is for classes that
        aren't ready to fight, but can at least take a hit. 8 base
        HP is enough to take some hits and get into combat a
        little, while 10 base HP is for skilled warriors and those
        who have no fear of battle.</p>

        <p>Damage is chosen from the dice available: d4, d6, d8,
        d10. The classes presented here all use a single die with
        no static bonus, but there's no reason not to experiment
        with other options: 2d4 or 1d6+2, for example. High HP and
        damage tend to go together, as you usually need one to make
        the other worthwhile.</p>

        <p>Bonds are where the class's outlook shines through. It's
        the place where you, the designer, will most clearly
        interact with the player at character creation. Unless the
        class is particularly social or antisocial, write four
        bonds. If the class is very connected to others, add a
        Bond, if they're cloistered remove one. Avoid bonds that
        dictate alignment but don't be afraid to say something
        about what the class is or does. You can use the rules for
        writing new Bonds as a starting point, but avoid including
        proper names in starting Bonds.</p>

        <p>Look is largely left to your imagination. This is an
        excellent spot to think about your fictional inspiration:
        what did they look like? How could they look different?
        Including at least one choice about clothes helps establish
        style without making the player think about buying
        clothes.</p>

        <p>The equipment choices should always include at least one
        weapon option and one armor option unless the class is
        clearly non-martial and lacking in fighting skill. Dungeon
        Rations are also pretty much required, a starting character
        without food going into a dangerous area borders on
        stupid.</p>

        <p>Alignments are your place to show the starting outlook
        of the class. Most classes will have Neutral as an option,
        since only the most dedicated classes are so tied up to an
        ideal that the self can't come first. A good alignment move
        is something that happens with some regularity and requires
        the player to take action they might not otherwise take. An
        alignment that happens as part of the normal course of
        play, like "When you gain treasure&hellip;," doesn't really
        show the character's ideals. Adding some requirements,
        maybe "When you gain treasure through lies and
        deceit&hellip;," adds an element of ideals. Now the
        alignment says something about the character (they prize
        pulling a con on the unsuspecting) and requires the player
        to think about how they play.</p>

        <h3>Compendium Classes</h3>

        <p class="NoIndent">A Compendium Class is a class only
        available to higher level characters who meet specific
        requirements. They're called Compendium Classes because
        they first appeared in the Compendiums for Dungeon World
        Basic. A Compendium Class is the way to go for a concept
        that can be layered onto multiple other classes.</p>

        <p>The basic structure of a Compendium Class is to have a
        starting move that is available only to characters who have
        had a certain experience, like this:</p>

        <p class="Example">When you enter the bodily presence of a
        god or their avatar the next time you gain a level you can
        choose this move instead of a move from your class:</p>

        <p class="Example">Divine Bond</p>

        <p class="Example">When you write a new Bond instead of
        using the name of another character you can use the name of
        a deity you've had contact with. Anytime a Bond with a
        deity applies to the current situation you can mark it off
        (as if it was resolved) to call on the deity's favor in a
        clear and decisive way that the GM describes. At the end of
        the session you then replace the marked off Bond with a new
        one, with a deity or player character.</p>

        <p>Note that the move is only available after the character
        has done a specific thing, and even then only at their next
        level. Compendium Classes are best when they rely on what
        the character has done, not stat prerequisites or anything
        that happens without the player's action. A Compendium
        Class that is available to anyone who just gained 5th level
        doesn't stand for much, one that only applies if you've
        been to Death's Black Gates and lived to tell the tale is
        more interesting.</p>

        <p>A Compendium Class also usually has 2&ndash;3 moves that
        can be taken only if the starting move is taken. These are
        just like normal class moves, just with the requirement
        that you have to have already taken the starting Compendium
        Class move.</p>

        <p>Compendium Classes are ideal for concepts that don't
        quite inspire a full class. If you can't think of what the
        class looks like or how much HP it has, or if the class
        overlaps with existing classes, it's probably better as a
        Compendium Class.</p>

        <h2>Adventure Moves</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Adventure moves deal directly with the
        adventure underway. They can move the action along, change
        the rewards, or let you jump into a bigger adventure.</p>

        <p>If you're running a short game, maybe at a convention or
        game day, you may find that you want to front load the
        experience a little more. Here's a move that covers "the
        adventure so far" so that you can get straight into a short
        game in media res.</p>

        <p class="Example">Stalwart Fighter: As if the bandits
        weren&rsquo;t bad enough! As if all the sword wounds,
        bruises and batterings at the hands of your enemies were
        insufficient&mdash;now this. Trapped underground with your
        adventuring companions when all you wanted was to return to
        the town and spend your well-earned bounty. No such luck,
        warrior. Sharpen that sword! Certainly, the others will
        need your protecting before safety is found. Just like last
        time. Once more into the breach, right? I swear, one of
        these fellow must owe you a favor or two by now&hellip;</p>

        <p class="Example">Have a look around and roll+Cha. On a
        10+ choose two party members, on a 7-9 just the one, on a
        miss you&rsquo;re surrounded by ingrates. At a moment of
        need, you can cash in an owed favor. A PC must change their
        action to one of your choosing, once. As long as this
        action doesn&rsquo;t involve them directly taking damage,
        giving up a magic item they already own or coming to
        immediate harm, it&rsquo;s fair game. Use it to make them
        agree with you, or give you that extra ration you want, or
        giving you their slot in the loot lottery. Leverage is
        sweet.</p>

        <p>The most important part of this move is not the roll or
        the effect, but the information and tone. It sets the stage
        for a quick adventure and gives the player reading it a
        starting point to work with. The roll and result here are
        interesting, but don't greatly change the flow of the game.
        Handing out a set of these, one to each player, along with
        a playbook, is a great way to run a con game.</p>

        <p>You can also adapt the End of Session move to reflect
        the adventure you're running. When doing this it's key that
        you show the players the new End of Session move. The goal
        isn't to keep them in the dark about what earns XP, but to
        make the XP awards tie directly to this adventure.</p>

        <p class="Example">When you end the session, instead of
        using the normal end of session questions, use these:</p>

        <ul>
          <li class="Exampleli">Did we learn something about the
          Cult of the Scaled God?</li>

          <li class="Exampleli">Did we rescue a captured villager
          or help defend the village of Secor?</li>

          <li class="Exampleli">Did we defeat a major agent of the
          Cult of the Scaled God</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Move Structure</h2>

        <p>Moves always follow a similar structure. The most basic
        parts of a move are the trigger ("when&hellip;") and the
        effect ("then&hellip;"). Every move follows this basic
        format.</p>

        <h3>Triggers</h3>

        <p>Triggers are always fictional actions undertaken by the
        player characters. Note that a trigger never deals with
        precise units of time. Don't write a move that begins "When
        you start a round adjacent to a dragon." There's no rounds
        (and adjacent is maybe not the best phrasing, as it sound
        removed from the fiction of <em>standing next to a damn
        fire-breathing dragon</em>). Prepare Spells isn't "When you
        spend one hour studying your spellbook" for good reason.
        Time in Dungeon World is a bit fluid, like in a movie where
        pacing depends on the circumstances. Don't rely on concrete
        units either around the table (rounds) or in the fiction
        (seconds, minutes, days).</p>

        <p>Here are some broad types of triggers:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>When a character takes action</strong>.
          Examples: Discern Realities, Fascinate [Bard], Command
          [Ranger].</li>

          <li><strong>When a character takes action under specific
          circumstances</strong>. Examples: Hack and Slash,
          Gladiator [Fighter], Backstab [Thief].</li>

          <li><strong>When circumstances dictate, no character
          action</strong>. Examples: Order Hirelings, End of
          Session, Saving Throw.</li>

          <li><strong>When a character uses a thing</strong>.
          Examples: Magic items, Heirloom [Fighter]</li>

          <li><strong>From now on</strong>. Examples: Serenity
          [Cleric], Poisoner [Thief]</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Effect</h3>

        <p>Moves effects can be anything you can think of; they are
        as limitless as your ideas. Don't feel constrained to
        making rolls, +1 bonuses, and swapping stats. Since all
        moves flow from the fiction, a fictional effect like "They
        treat you as a friend" is just as powerful and useful as +1
        forward, maybe more so.</p>

        <p>Here are some broad types of effects, any given move may
        use more than one of them:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Roll</strong>. Examples: Defy Danger, Cast a
          Spell [Wizard], Called Shot [Ranger].</li>

          <li><strong>Substitute stats</strong>. Examples: Precise
          [weapon tag].</li>

          <li><strong>Trigger another move</strong>. Examples:
          Charm Person [Wizard spell], Envenom [Thief].</li>

          <li><strong>Give a bonus or penalty, forward or
          ongoing.</strong> Examples: Quarry [Ranger], Beacon of
          Good [Paladin].</li>

          <li><strong>Deal or heal damage</strong>. Examples:
          Volley, Backstab [Thief], Called Shot [Ranger].</li>

          <li><strong>Choose options</strong>. Examples: Spout
          Lore, Discern Realities, Ritual [Wizard].</li>

          <li><strong>Hold &amp; Spend</strong>. Examples: Dominate
          [Wizard spell], Trap Sense [Thief].</li>

          <li><strong>Ask &amp; Answer</strong>. Examples: Charming
          and Open [Bard], Spout Lore.</li>

          <li><strong>Change circumstances</strong>. Examples:
          Ascetic Freedom [Cleric], Sins of the Flesh
          [Paladin].</li>

          <li><strong>Mark experience</strong>. Examples: Alignment
          moves.</li>

          <li><strong>Call for more information</strong>. Examples:
          Parley, Ritual [Wizard].</li>

          <li><strong>Add options</strong>. Examples: Survivalist
          [Ranger], Eye of Riches [Thief].</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Changing the Basics</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Moves can also change the basic
        structure of the game. Consider this one, to avoid the use
        of damage dice:</p>

        <p class="Example">When you would deal damage, instead of
        rolling the dice, substitute each dice with the listed
        number. d4 becomes 2, d6 becomes 3, d8 becomes 4, d10
        becomes 5, d12 becomes 6.</p>

        <p>Moves like this change one of the basic features of the
        game. Be very careful with moves that muck with the
        fundamentals. Any move that contradicts the GM's principles
        or agenda, or any move that breaks the basic "take the
        action to gain the effect" rule, should be seriously
        rethought.</p>

        <p>There are some parts of the game that are exceptionally
        easy to change. The amount of XP to level reflects our
        view, but you can easily make leveling more or less rare.
        The way stats are assigned by the class is a way of making
        the game easier for new players and reflecting the concept
        of each class but there may be a place for a 17
        Constitution Wizard. If you've played enough to know what
        you're doing with each stat feel free to assign them
        however you like.</p>

        <p>Another basic that's occasionally asked for is a way to
        make, say, fighting a dragon harder. The best answer here
        is that fighting a dragon is harder because the dragon is
        fictionally stronger. Just stabbing a dragon with a normal
        blade isn't Hack and Slash because a typical blade can't
        hurt it. If, however, that isn't enough, consider this move
        from Vincent Baker, originally from Apocalypse World
        (reworded slightly to match Dungeon World rules):</p>

        <p class="Example">When a player makes a move and the GM
        judges it especially difficult, the player takes -1 to the
        roll. When a player's character makes a move and the GM
        judges it clearly beyond them, the player takes -2 to the
        roll.</p>

        <p>The problem with this move is that the move no longer
        reflects anything concrete. Instead, the move is a prompt
        for the GM to make judgement calls with no clear framework.
        If you find yourself writing this custom move, consider
        what difficulty you're really trying to capture and make a
        custom move for that instead. That said, this is a valid
        custom move, if you feel it's needed.</p>

        <h2>Development of a Move</h2>

        <p>Let's look at how one move developed over time. Hack and
        Slash was one of the earliest Dungeon World moves,
        originally written by Tony Dowler. The first version looked
        like this (this version has been reformatted and edited for
        grammar only):</p>

        <p class="Example">When you wade into combat, attacking
        your enemies, deal damage to the enemy you&rsquo;re
        attacking, take that enemy&rsquo;s damage, and roll+Str. On
        a 10+, choose 2. On a 7-9 choose 1.</p>

        <ul>
          <li class="Exampleli">Prevent one ally from taking damage
          this round</li>

          <li class="Exampleli">Kill one enemy of lower level than
          you or deal max damage to otherwise</li>

          <li class="Exampleli">Put an enemy right where you want
          them (drive them off, prevent them from fleeing,
          etc.)</li>

          <li class="Exampleli">Divide your damage amongst any
          number of targets you can reach with your weapon</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The first problem with this move is that one of the
        options, preventing damage, is far less useful than the
        others. Being able to outright kill an enemy is nearly
        always better than preventing that enemy from doing damage.
        The first major revision was to drop that option:</p>

        <p class="Example">When you wade into combat, attacking
        your enemies, deal damage to the enemy you&rsquo;re
        attacking, take that enemy&rsquo;s damage, and roll+Str. On
        a 10+ choose 2. On a 7-9 choose 1.</p>

        <ul>
          <li class="Exampleli">Kill one enemy of lower level than
          you or deal max damage to otherwise</li>

          <li class="Exampleli">Put an enemy right where you want
          them (drive them off, prevent them from fleeing,
          etc.)</li>

          <li class="Exampleli">Divide your damage amongst any
          number of targets you can reach with your weapon</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This left only three options which is a great number of
        options to have when a 10+ lets you pick two. The player
        making the move always had to not choose one option. All of
        the options are also clearly useful. But there's still an
        issue, easily the biggest issue with this move: the
        fictional action doesn't tightly relate to the outcome.</p>

        <p>Consider this situation: Gregor attacks an eagle lord
        with his mighty axe. He describes his fictional action: "I
        swing my axe right down on his wing with a big overhead
        chop." Then he rolls the move, gets a 10, and makes his
        choices. Max damage is a clear choice and comes right from
        the fiction. The other options, however, don't make much
        sense. If he chooses to divide his damage, how does that
        flow from his one fictional attack? How did that one chop
        also hit the treant behind him?</p>

        <p>Scoping down the fictional effect of the move lead to
        his version:</p>

        <p class="Example">When you attack an enemy who can defend
        themselves, roll+Str. On a 10+, you deal your damage but
        your enemy does not get to deal theirs to you. If you
        choose, you can take your enemy's damage and deal double
        damage to the enemy. On a 7-9, you take the enemy's damage
        and deal your damage.</p>

        <p>Here the move now has only the effects that could
        clearly follow from a single attack. Any action that
        couldn't reasonably lead to a counter-attack isn't Hack and
        Slash, so now the trigger matches the effects.
        Unfortunately double damage was a bit much, so we changed
        it to this:</p>

        <p class="Example">When you attack an enemy in melee,
        roll+Str. On a 7-9, you deal your damage to the enemy and
        take their damage. On a 10+ you deal your damage to the
        enemy. You can choose to also take the enemy's damage to
        deal +2 damage.</p>

        <p>+2 damage is a clear advantage, but not a game-breaker.
        The only problem here is that it reduced the effects of an
        attack to taking damage. Monsters do so much more than just
        take away your HP; monsters hurl you about the room and
        destroy the ground you stand on, why can't they do that in
        response?</p>

        <p class="Example">When you attack an enemy in melee,
        roll+Str. On a 10+ you deal your damage to the enemy. You
        can choose to let the enemy make an attack to deal +2
        damage. On a 7-9, you deal your damage to the enemy and the
        enemy makes an attack against you.</p>

        <p>This version (the final one) allows a monster to
        "attack" not just deal damage. That opens up a whole host
        of interesting monster moves to be used. Now even the 7-9
        result has choices to make and unpredictable outcomes.</p>

        <h2>Agenda, Principles, and GM Moves</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">Changing the GM's side of the rules is
        an entirely different beast from writing custom player
        moves. Writing GM moves is the easy part. Since a GM move
        is just a statement of something that fictionally happens,
        feel free to write new ones as you please. Most of the time
        you'll find they're just specific cases of one of the moves
        already established, but occasionally you'll come across
        something new. Just keep in mind the spectrum of hard to
        soft moves, your principles, and your agenda and you'll be
        fine. Removing a GM move is also kosher, but you're
        probably better off keeping the move and just not using it.
        The players won't know anyway.</p>

        <p>Changing the GM's agenda or principles is one of the
        biggest changes you can make to the game. Changing these
        areas will likely require changes throughout the rest of
        the game, plus playtesting to nail it all down.</p>

        <p><strong>Play to find out what happens</strong> is the
        least changeable part of the GM's agenda. Other options,
        like "play towards your set plot" or "play to challenge the
        players' skills" will be resisted pretty strongly by the
        other rules. The moves give the players abilities that can
        change the course of an planned adventure quite quickly; if
        you're not playing to find out what happens you'll have to
        resist the moves at every step or rewrite many of them.</p>

        <p><strong>Fill the characters' lives with
        adventure</strong> could be rephrased, but it's hard to
        really change. "Fill the characters' lives with intrigue"
        might work, but intrigue just seems like a type of
        adventure. Removing this agenda entirely will require major
        reworking since the move structure is based on this. The
        effects of a miss and the GM's soft moves are all there to
        create a life of adventure.</p>

        <p><strong>Make the world fantastic</strong> is maybe the
        easiest to change, but it still requires considerable
        rewriting of the class moves. A historical world, a grim
        world, or a utopian world are all possible, but you'll need
        to carefully rethink many moves. A historical world will
        require magic, equipment, and several other sections to be
        nearly entirely rewritten or removed. A grim world can only
        survive if the players' moves come with darker costs. A
        utopian world won't need many of the moves as written.
        Still, this is the easiest part of the agenda to change,
        since it requires changing the moves, not the basic
        structures of the game.</p>

        <p>The GM's principles are more mutable than the agenda but
        still can seriously change the game with only minor
        modifications. <strong>Address the characters, not the
        players; Make your move, but misdirect; Never speak the
        name of your move; Begin and end with the fiction;</strong>
        and <strong>Be a fan of the characters</strong> are the
        most important principles. Without these the conversation
        of play and the use of moves is likely to break down.</p>

        <p><strong>Embrace the fantastic; Give every monster life;
        Name every person; Think Dangerous;</strong> and
        <strong>Give them something to work towards</strong> are
        key to the spirit of Dungeon World and fantasy exploration.
        These are changeable, but they amount to changing the
        setting of the game. If you want to change any of these,
        you may have to make changes to all of them.</p>

        <p><strong>Leave Blanks; Sometimes, let them
        decide;</strong> and <strong>Ask questions and use the
        answers</strong> are important to running Dungeon World
        well. They also apply to many other games in the same
        style. The game will be diminished without them, but the
        conversation of play will continue. These are also some of
        the most portable principles, applicable to many other
        games. They may even work in games with very different play
        styles.</p>

        <p>An additional principle that some people prefer to add
        is <strong>Test their Bonds</strong>. This principle is
        entirely compatible with the others and with all the moves,
        but it changes the focus of the game somewhat. Fronts need
        to be rethought to work fully with this, and you might need
        to add moves that speak to it.</p>

        <h2>Monsters</h2>

        <p class="NoIndent">The easiest place to modify monsters is
        in the questions used to create them. The simplest changes
        have to do with adjusting lethality or randomness to your
        liking. You could easily change just one question to add
        random damage to the game (if you use random monster damage
        you might consider having the players roll it so that you
        don't have to manage dice just for damage).</p>

        <h4>How does it usually hunt or fight?</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>As part of large group, five or more: 2d4 damage, 1
          HP, Horde</li>

          <li>As part of a small group, around 2&ndash;5: 2d6
          damage, 8 HP</li>

          <li>All by its lonesome: 2d10 damage, 30 HP, Unique</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Note that these changes also adjust lethality slightly,
        you can play with the numbers to make it more or less
        random as you please.</p>

        <p>A more interesting change is to change the questions
        being asked to present a different view of monsters. The
        views built into the questions imply that monsters are more
        or less like other creatures: they can be of many
        alignments and won't always be opposed to the player
        characters. If you want to make Dungeon World more about
        indiscriminate killing of monsters that deserve it you
        might rewrite some of the questions, maybe adding this:</p>

        <h4>The monster is Evil through and through. Choose one to
        reflect why it's evil:</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>It's an intrusion of the Old Ones Beyond The Walls:
          Planar, +5 damage</li>

          <li>It's a product of the Old Wizards of the Red Tower:
          Construct, +5 HP</li>

          <li>It's from The Time Before Man: Primordial, +5 damage,
          +5 HP</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When creating new monster questions you can either
        reinterpret existing monsters by answering the questions
        for them again or only use the new questions for new
        monsters. If the new questions you add or change are key to
        your vision of Dungeon World its best to redo all the
        monsters you use, if the question only applies to a
        specific kind of monster anyway you can just use it for new
        monsters.</p>

      <p class="NoIndent">Since you've read this book it's likely
      at some point you'll be teaching the game to others, either
      experienced roleplayers or those new to the hobby. Throughout
      the design process we've had many chances to play with lots
      of different gamers from different backgrounds and there are
      a few things we've found work well for teaching the game.</p>

      <h2>Pitch It</h2>

      <p class="NoIndent">Before you play you'll likely be
      explaining the game to your new players (don't just spring it
      on them, that's not cool). We call that the pitch: it's
      explaining why you want to play Dungeon World and why you
      think they'll like it.</p>

      <p>First and most importantly: put it in your own words. We
      can't give you a script because the best way to get people
      excited about the game is to share your honest excitement.
      There are, however, some things you might want to touch
      on.</p>

      <p>With first-time roleplayers it's best to focus on what
      roleplaying means in Dungeon World. Tell them what they'll be
      doing (portraying a character) and what you'll be doing
      (portraying the world around them). Mention the general
      conceit (adventurers and adventure). It's usually a good idea
      to mention the role of the rules too, how they're there to
      drive the action forward in interesting ways.</p>

      <p>With folks who've played RPGs before, especially those
      who've played other fantasy adventure games, you can focus
      more on what makes Dungeon World different from other similar
      games. Ease-of-play, the way the rules just step in at the
      right times, and the fast pace are all things that
      experienced roleplayers often appreciate.</p>

      <p>No matter the audience, don't just pitch Dungeon World,
      pitch the game you're going to run. If this is going to be a
      trip into the city sewers, tell them that right up front. If
      there's an evil cult to be stopped that should be part of
      your description. The interaction between you, the players,
      and the rules will create all kinds of interesting secrets
      later on, your pitch should honestly portray the game you
      intend to run.</p>

      <h2>Present the Classes</h2>

      <p class="NoIndent">Once everybody's on board for a game of
      Dungeon World and you've sat down to play start by presenting
      the character sheets. Give a short description of each,
      making sure to mention what each does and their place in the
      world. You can also read out the descriptions for each class,
      those all include something about both what the class does
      and how that fits into the big picture.</p>

      <p>If anybody has questions about the rules, answer them, but
      for now focus on describing what the classes do in plain
      terms. If someone asks about the fighter it's more useful to
      tell them that the fighter has a signature weapon that's one
      of a kind then to go into detail about how the Signature
      Weapon move works.</p>

      <h2>Create Characters</h2>

      <p class="NoIndent">Go through the character creation rules
      step-by-step. The process of creating a character is also a
      great introduction to the basic concepts: the players will
      encounter stats, moves, HP, and damage all in an order that
      makes sense. Don't bother trying to front-load the rules
      explanations. There aren't really any wrong choices.</p>

      <p>Each player will encounter the rules that are important to
      their class. The Fighter, for example, will see moves about
      weapon ranges and piercing and ask about them, explain them
      as needed. If the Fighter player doesn't ask you what
      piercing is, don't worry about it. They're happy to choose
      based on the fiction, which is all the stats and tags reflect
      anyway.</p>

      <p>If your players are particularly worried about making
      their characters 'right' just give them the option of
      changing them later. Trying to cover every rule and give them
      all the context now will just slow the game down. In
      particular, don't go over the basic moves in detail yet.
      Leave them out so that the players can read them and ask
      questions, but don't waste time by explaining each. They'll
      come up as needed.</p>

      <p>As the players introduce their characters and start
      setting bonds move from answering questions to asking them.
      Ask about why they chose what they did and what that means
      for their character. Ask about details established by their
      bonds. Let their choices establish the world around them.
      Take special note of anything that you think you might be
      able to make moves with (like an estranged teacher or a
      simmering war).</p>

      <h3>Start Play</h3>

      <p class="NoIndent">Start play by concretely describing the
      world around them. Keep it brief and evocative, use plenty of
      details, and end with something that demands action. Then ask
      them what they do.</p>

      <p>Ending with something that demands action is important.
      Don't presume that new players will already know what they
      want to do. Giving them something to react to right away
      means you get straight to playing.</p>

      <p>Especially for new players make sure that the action
      they're thrown into is something they have the tools to deal
      with. A fight is a good choice, as is a tense negotiation
      (which can easily become a fight). Keep it simple and let the
      complexity build.</p>

      <p>Even in a fight keep to simple monsters: things that
      bleed, don't have too much armor, and don't have piercing.
      Give them a chance to get used to their armor and dealing
      damage before you start using the exceptions to those rules,
      like piercing and ignoring armor. Of course if the fiction
      dictates ignoring armor or piercing or a certain monster, use
      it, but don't lead with those.</p>

      <p>For new players make liberal use of your Show Signs of
      Doom move. New players, or those used to a different type of
      fantasy adventure, may have different assumptions about
      what's lethal and when they're in danger, so make sure to
      show them danger clearly. Once they've started to pick up on
      what's dangerous you can give them a little less warning.</p>

      <p>If you're GMing for the first time focus on a few moves:
      Show Signs of Doom, Deal Damage, Put Someone in a Spot. Only
      look at your moves sheet if you're pretty sure none of those
      three apply. Eventually you'll build up familiarity with the
      whole range of GM moves and using them will seem like second
      nature.</p>

      <h3>Continuing Play</h3>

      <p class="NoIndent">After an hour or two of play the players
      will likely have everything down. As a first time GM you may
      take a bit longer to pick up all your moves, maybe a session
      or two. Just roll with it.</p>

      <p>If you find yourself struggling in the first session
      consider it a pilot, like the first episode of a TV show.
      Feel free to start over or retroactively change things. If a
      player decides that the Thief just isn't what they thought it
      was let them switch classes (either remaking the same
      character or introducing someone new). If your first
      adventure wasn't working too well scrap it and start
      something new.</p>

      <p>While Dungeon World works great for one-shots the longer
      cycles of levels and bonds don't really kick in for a bit. If
      your first one or two sessions go well consider scheduling
      out enough time for 5&ndash;10 more. Knowing that you're
      planning to play that much longer gives you some space to
      plan out your fronts and resolve them.</p>
    </div>

    <div xmlns:aid="http://ns.adobe.com/AdobeInDesign/4.0/">
      <p class="NoIndent">There isn&rsquo;t always time for prep.
      People aren&rsquo;t entirely committed to a game&mdash;you
      just want to test it out or you&rsquo;ve got a four-hour slot
      at a convention that you want to fill and you&rsquo;ve never
      met the players before in your life. Maybe prep isn&rsquo;t
      something you care about or you think it&rsquo;s more fun to
      just take a map and run with it. Even better, maybe
      you&rsquo;ve got a favorite old-school adventure module and
      you&rsquo;d love to run through using the Dungeon World
      rules. In this appendix, we&rsquo;ll cover how to convert and
      adapt material from other games into Dungeon World and give
      you the same flexibility to run your favorite adventures
      using the rules in this book.</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p class="NoIndent">The first step in preparing an adventure
      for use with Dungeon World is reading through that adventure,
      and through the Dungeon World rules. For this book,
      you&rsquo;ll want to be familiar with all the basic rules, as
      well as familiar with the section on Fronts and on the GM
      principles. The former will be guiding you in adapting the
      framework of the adventure and the latter will help keep your
      mind going in the right direction&mdash;so that gameplay
      stays true to the style and rules set out in this book.
      You&rsquo;ll want to read through the module next, paying
      close attention to the four following topics as you go.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Maps</li>

        <li>Monsters</li>

        <li>Magic Items</li>

        <li>NPCs and Organizations</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Flip through the adventure, make some notes as you go, but
      don&rsquo;t feel you need to memorize the whole thing. Areas
      that focus particularly on statistics are likely to end up
      ignored, and you&rsquo;ll want to leave blanks in the
      adventure for you and the players to discover as you go.</p>

      <p>When you&rsquo;ve finished, you&rsquo;ll have a broad
      understanding about what the adventure is about&mdash;the
      power groups at play in it, the special or cool monsters the
      adventure contains, the threats and dangers that its cast
      present to the world and the kinds of things the PCs might be
      interested in. Set aside the adventure for now, and refer to
      the Fronts section of Dungeon World. This is where the
      majority of your work is going to take place.</p>

      <h2>Fronts</h2>

      <p class="NoIndent">The core of any standard adventure,
      scenario or game session in Dungeon World flows outward from
      the Fronts to the players; the Fronts have their Impending
      Dooms, the players react, and in the space between, you play
      the game to find out what happens. The same is true when
      presenting a converted adventure. Reading through the module,
      you&rsquo;ll have noticed things&mdash;NPCs, places of
      interest, special monsters and organizations that might have
      an impact on the world or some agenda to carry out. Depending
      on the size of the adventure, there may be just one or a few
      of these. Take a look through the list of Front types and
      create one for each group.</p>

      <p class="Example">I&rsquo;m going to convert an old
      adventure I love; I&rsquo;ve run it a dozen times in a bunch
      of different systems and I think it&rsquo;d be a blast to run
      my Dungeon World group through. I&rsquo;ve given myself a
      quick read through to remind myself what the adventure is all
      about. In this case, there&rsquo;s a town being menaced in
      secret by a wicked cult who worships a squamous reptile god.
      Sounds like fun! The adventure has a secret dungeon, a
      corrupt religious order, a bunch of smelly troglodytes and
      some very helpless adventurers. I&rsquo;ve decided that the
      Fronts in this adventure are The Cultists and The Troglodyte
      Clan</p>

      <p class="Example">Now, I could make the sorcerous Naga that
      lives in the caverns her own Front, if I wanted to, or I
      could add in a Campaign Front for the Reptile God itself, but
      I think I&rsquo;ll only be running this game a few sessions,
      so I&rsquo;m going to stay focused. The two Fronts I have
      work together in some ways, but are unique and operate
      independently, so I&rsquo;ve separated them.</p>

      <p class="NoIndent">Create these Fronts like you would
      normally, choosing dangers, impending dooms, and grim
      portents. Ask one or two stakes questions but be sure to
      leave yourself lots of room&mdash;that&rsquo;s where you can
      really tie in the characters. Normally, you&rsquo;d be
      pulling these things straight out of the inspiration of your
      brain, but in this case, you&rsquo;ve got the module to guide
      you. Think about the Fronts as themes, and the Dangers as
      elements from the pages of your module. Look at the kinds of
      things your Fronts are said to be doing in the adventure and
      how that might go if the PCs were never there to stop it.
      What&rsquo;s the worst that could happen if the Fronts were
      able to run rampant? This kind of reading-between-the-lines
      will give you ammunition for making your hard moves as you
      play through the adventure. This step is where you&rsquo;ll
      turn those stat-block NPCs into either full-fledged dangers
      themselves, or members of the Front&rsquo;s cast.</p>

      <p>If there are any traps, curses or general effects in the
      adventure you&rsquo;d like to write custom moves for, do it
      now. A lot of old adventures will have elements that call for
      a &ldquo;saving throw&rdquo; to avoid some noisome
      effect&mdash;these can often simply be a cause for a Defy
      Danger roll, or can have whole, separate custom moves if
      necessary. The key here is to capture the intent of the
      adventure&mdash;the spirit of the thing&mdash;rather than
      translate some mechanical element perfectly.</p>

      <p>When you&rsquo;re done, you&rsquo;ll have a set of Fronts
      that cover the major threats and dangers the characters will
      face.</p>

      <h2>Monsters</h2>

      <p class="NoIndent">Most published adventures contained one
      or two unique monsters not seen anywhere else&mdash;custom
      creatures and denizens of the deeps that could threaten
      players in some way they hadn&rsquo;t encountered before.
      Take a look through the adventure and make sure you&rsquo;ve
      caught them all. Many monsters will already have statistics
      noted in Dungeon World and you can, if you&rsquo;re happy
      with them, just make a note of what page they&rsquo;re on in
      your Fronts and move on from there. If you want to further
      customize the monsters, or need to create your own, use the
      rules to do so. In this step, try to avoid thinking about
      &ldquo;balancing&rdquo; the monsters or concerning yourself
      too much with how many HP a monster has or whether its armor
      rating matches what you expect. Think more about how the
      monster is meant to participate in the adventure. Is it there
      to scare the pcs? Is it there to bar their way or pose a
      riddle? What is its purpose in the greater ecology of the
      dungeon or adventure at large? Translating the spirit of the
      thing will always give you better, more engaging results. If
      the monster has a cool power or neat trick you want to write
      a custom move for, do so! Custom moves are what make Dungeon
      World feel unique from group to group, so take advantage of
      them where you can.</p>

      <p class="Example">In my adventure, the monsters run the
      gamut. I&rsquo;ve got a scary naga with some mind-controlling
      powers, an evil priest with divine snake-god magic, a bunch
      of ruffian cultists, a dragon turtle and a few miscellaneous
      lizards, crocodiles and snakes. Most of these I can pull from
      the Monster Settings, but I&rsquo;ll create custom stats for
      the Naga and the cultist leader, at least. I want them to
      feel new and different and have some cool ideas for how that
      might look. I use the monster creation rules to put them
      together.</p>

      <h3>Direct Conversion</h3>

      <p class="NoIndent">If you run across a monster that you
      haven't already created and which you don't know well enough
      to convert using the monster creation rules you can instead
      convert them directly.</p>

      <h4>Damage</h4>

      <p class="NoIndent">If the monster's damage is a single dice
      with a bonus of up to +10 keep it as-is. If the monster's
      damage uses multiple dice of the same size roll the listed
      dice and take the highest result. If the monster uses
      multiple dice of different sizes roll only the largest and
      take the highest result.</p>

      <h4>HP</h4>

      <p class="NoIndent">If the monster's HP is listed as Hit Dice
      take the maximum value of the first HD and add one for each
      additional hit dice. If the monster's HP is listed as a
      number with no Hit Dice divide the HP by 4.</p>

      <h4>Armor</h4>

      <p class="NoIndent">If the monster's AC is average give it 1
      armor. If the monster's AC is low, give it 0 armor. If the
      monster's AC is high give it 2 armor, 3 armor for beasts that
      are all about defense. If it's nearly invulnerable, 4 armor.
      +1 armor if it's defenses are magical.</p>

      <h4>Moves and Instinct</h4>

      <p class="NoIndent">Look at the special abilities or attacks
      listed for the monster, these form the basis for its
      moves.</p>

      <h2>Maps</h2>

      <p class="NoIndent">One of the biggest differences between
      Dungeon World and many other fantasy RPGs is the concept of
      maps and mapping. In many games, you&rsquo;ll see a
      square-by-square map denoting precisely what goes where,
      often presented to give as much detail as possible and leave
      little to the imagination save the description of the
      location in question. Dungeon World often leans the opposite
      direction&mdash;maps marked with empty space and a one or two
      word description like &ldquo;blades&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;scary.&rdquo; To adapt an existing adventure for use
      in Dungeon World, simply keep in mind your Principles and
      Agenda. Primarily, keep in mind that as the GM, it&rsquo;s
      your job to &ldquo;draw maps, leave blanks&rdquo; and to
      &ldquo;ask questions and use the answers.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>To that end, it&rsquo;s often best to re-draw the map
      entirely, if you have time. Don&rsquo;t copy it inch-by-inch
      but redraw it freehand, leaving spaces and drawing out new
      rooms, if you&rsquo;d like. Don&rsquo;t stick to the map
      exactly as written, but give yourself some creative license.
      The idea here is to give yourself room to expand&mdash;to
      allow the players&rsquo; reaction to the adventure to
      surprise and inspire you. If you&rsquo;ve got the whole map
      nailed down in advance, there&rsquo;s nowhere to go you
      don&rsquo;t already know about, is there? Pick a few rooms
      that don&rsquo;t interest you and wipe out their inhabitants.
      Draw a new tunnel or two. This will give you some space to
      play around once you get into the game itself.</p>

      <p>If you don&rsquo;t have the time or inclination to re-draw
      the map, don&rsquo;t worry. Just take the original map, make
      a few notes about what might go where and leave the rest
      blank. When the players go into that room marked
      &ldquo;4f&rdquo; don&rsquo;t look it up, just make a guess at
      what might be there based on your notes and what else has
      been happening. You&rsquo;ll find a comfortable balance
      between freely playing out what happens and consulting your
      prep as you go along.</p>

      <p class="Example">The maps that come with my adventure are a
      good mix of fun and cool and sort of boring fluff. I&rsquo;ll
      keep most of what the dungeon describes under the
      city&mdash;the lair of the troglodytes and the secret caves
      where the captive villagers are being kept&mdash;but
      I&rsquo;m going to throw away a lot of the stuff about the
      village itself and just leave blank spaces. It&rsquo;ll give
      me room to use the answers to questions like &ldquo;who do
      you already know, here?&rdquo; and &ldquo;who lives in the
      abandoned hut up the road?&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve made some notes
      about where the map and my Fronts intersect, but mostly
      I&rsquo;ve just given myself room to explore.</p>

      <h2>Magic &amp; Treasure</h2>

      <p class="NoIndent">Two things that are, traditionally, a
      &ldquo;big deal&rdquo; in published modules are treasure and
      magic items. This is less relevant in Dungeon World (as the
      reward cycle for characters is more about &ldquo;doing&rdquo;
      than about &ldquo;having&rdquo;) but it&rsquo;s still fun to
      drudge through a dungeon or explore lost ruins and come up
      with cool magic items and piles of gold! Like the map,
      it&rsquo;s useful to get an idea of the kinds of stuff that
      might be found in the adventure&mdash;anything particularly
      called out in the text as relevant to the adventure itself (a
      magic sword that can be used to wound the golem on level 4,
      or a pendant belonging to the prince captured in room 3) is
      particularly important. Like monsters, it&rsquo;s better to
      look at magic items in terms of what purpose they fulfill:
      what they&rsquo;re &ldquo;for&rdquo; rather than the damage
      or armor bonus they might give. Dungeon World isn&rsquo;t
      built on balancing treasure against character level, for
      example, so just look through the adventure for items that
      seem cool or fun or interesting and create new magic items
      (with custom moves as necessary) wherever you think
      it&rsquo;s needed. This is possibly the easiest step of
      conversion. Again, you can leave yourself exploratory room,
      here. Make notes to yourself like &ldquo;the wizard has a
      magic staff, what does it do?&rdquo; and find that out in
      play. Ask the players about it, see what they have to say.
      Let Spout Lore do some work for you. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
      heard that the wizard here has a strange magical staff. What
      rumors have you heard of its origins?&rdquo;</p>

      <h2>Introductory Moves</h2>

      <p class="NoIndent">This step is entirely optional, but can
      be really useful when running through an adventure for a
      convention group or other group where running through a full
      &ldquo;first session&rdquo; process just isn&rsquo;t
      possible. You can take variables of the adventure and create
      &ldquo;hooks&rdquo; for that adventure, writing custom moves
      to be made after character creation but before play starts.
      These moves will serve to engage the characters in the
      fiction and give them something special to prepare them or
      hook them into what&rsquo;s about to happen. You can write
      one for each class, or bundle them together, if you like.
      Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>

      <p class="Example">Fighter, someone who loves you gave you a
      gift before you left for a life of adventure. Roll + CHA and
      tell us how much they love you. On a 10+ pick two heirlooms,
      on a 7-9 pick one . On a miss, well, good intentions count
      for something, right?</p>

      <ul>
        <li>a vial of antivenom</li>

        <li>a shield that glows with silver light</li>

        <li>a rusted old key in the shape of a lizard</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="NoIndent">These sorts of moves can give the players
      the sense that their characters are tied to the situation at
      hand, and open the door for more lines of question-and-answer
      play that can fill the game world with life. Think about the
      Fronts, the things they endanger, the riches they might
      protect and their impact on the world. Let these intro moves
      flow from that understanding, creating a great kick-start to
      the adventure.</p>
    </div>

    <div xmlns:aid="http://ns.adobe.com/AdobeInDesign/4.0/">
      <p class="NoIndent">Sometimes the players will come across
      someone who becomes important in the moment. When the ritual
      goes wrong and a poor captive gets the power cosmic what does
      that villager do with it? Who were they?</p>

      <p>When you need a quick NPC all you need is an instinct and
      some way to pursue it. We call that a Knack, it can be
      anything from a skill to a title to a debt owed. Combine the
      two and you have an NPC who has something they want and a way
      to try to get it, you're ready to go.</p>
