## Some Informations about PDFs

* `dwpocket.pdf` is a three-columns document laid out on what I call an hybrid sheets which is 21cm wide and 11 inches high. This way, this PDF will print out nicely on both sides of the pond. 

* `dwpocket_ub.pdf` is a three-columns document typeset for on-screen reading on latest notebook whose monitor has a 16/9 ratio. 

* `dwpocket_nb.pdf` is a three-columns document typeset for on-screen reading on latest notebook whose monitor has a 16/10 ratio (mid-2000's notebook)

* `dwpocket_ipad.pdf` is a two-columns document typeset for well, duh, ipads and tablets sporting similar resolutions

* `dwpocket_hh.pdf` is a one column document typeset for half-hybrid sheets (see first item). I guess it can be also read on tablets and ebook readers with PDF-reading capabilities.
