DungeonWorld-ConTeXt
====================

This repository contains all data files needed to compile a PDF of the complete game DungeonWorld.

Tools are not included, an INSTALL file will follow quite soon. (Say before the end of May, 2012) 

.tex files in there are a translation of DW's text files placed under CC-3.0-BY and available 
there: https://github.com/Sagelt/Dungeon-World

That being said, all credits go to Sage Latorra for making DW text available for the general public.
