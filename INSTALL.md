# Installation steps

1. Your main TeX/ConTeXt binaries should  be in your PATH. Check whether `texfont` and `texexec` can be reached via command-line
2. go into `./fonts` directory and launch `install-fonts.bat` or `install-fonts.sh`. This is an one-time setup step. Should I ever change the fonts, you will be notified.
3. go into `./tex` directory and launch `make-pdf.bat` or `make-pdf.sh`. If everything goes OK, you should find a newly-created .pdf file in your directory
