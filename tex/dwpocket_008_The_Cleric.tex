The lands of Dungeon World are a gods-forsaken mess. They’re lousy with the walking dead, beasts of all sorts, and the vast unnatural spaces between safe and temple-blessed civilizations. It is a godless world out there. That’s why it needs you.

 

Bringing the glory of your god to the heathens isn’t just in your nature—it’s your calling. It falls to you to proselytize with sword and mace and spell. To cleave deep into the witless heart of the wilds and plant the seed of divinity there. Some say that it is best to keep god close to your heart. You know that’s rubbish. God lives at the edge of a blade. Show the world who is lord.

\subsection{Deity}  \index{Deity} \index{Deity}
 

You serve and worship some deity or power which grants you spells. Give your god a name (maybe Helferth, Sucellus, or Zorica) and choose your deity’s domain:

 
\startitemize[1,packed]

\item Healing and Restoration

 
\item Bloody Conquest

 
\item Civilization

 
\item Knowledge and Hidden Things

 
\item The Downtrodden and Forgotten

 
\item What Lies Beneath


\stopitemize
 

Choose one precept of your religion:

 
\startitemize[1,packed]

\item Your religion preaches the sanctity of suffering, add Petition: Suffering

 
\item Your religion is cultish and insular, add Petition: Gaining Secrets

 
\item Your religion has important sacrificial rites, add Petition: Offering

 
\item Your religion believes in trial by combat, add Petition: Personal Victory


\stopitemize


 


\subsection{Divine Guidance}  \index{Divine Guidance} \index{Divine} \index{Guidance}
 

When you fulfill your religion’s petition your deity grants you some useful knowledge or boon related to their domain. The GM will tell you what.



 


\subsection{Turn Undead}  \index{Turn Undead} \index{Turn} \index{Undead}
 

When you hold your holy symbol aloft and pray aloud for protection, roll+Wis. On a hit so long as you continue to pray and brandish your holy symbol no undead may come within reach of you. On a 10+ intelligent undead are momentarily dazed by the radiance of your god and mindless undead flee. If you move aggressively towards an undead creature while Turning them it breaks the effects and they are able to act as normal. Intelligent undead, vampires and so on, may still find ways to harry you from afar. They're clever like that.



 


\subsection{Commune}  \index{Commune} \index{Commune}
 

When you spend uninterrupted time (an hour or so) in quiet communion with your deity, you lose any spells already granted to you and are granted new spells of your choice whose total levels don't exceed your own+1. You also prepare your rotes; they don't count against your limit. You can't prepare spells that are higher level than you.



 


\subsection{Cast a Spell}  \index{Cast a Spell} \index{Cast} \index{Spell}
 

When you unleash a spell granted to you by your deity, roll+Wis. On a 10+, the spell is successfully cast and your deity does not revoke the spell, so you may cast it again. On a 7-9, the spell is cast, but choose one:

 
\startitemize[1,packed]

\item You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot (the GM will describe it).

 
\item Your casting distances you from your deity—take -1 ongoing to Cast a Spell until you Commune.

 
\item After you cast it, the spell is revoked by your deity. You cannot cast the spell again until you Commune and have it granted to you.
