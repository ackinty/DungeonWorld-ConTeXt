# Requirements

You will need the following stuff to build the PDF out of my .tex files:

## Perl
  
  * Usually installed out of the box on OSX, Linux. For Win users out there, I suggest Straberry Perl. http://strawberryperl.com/
  
## Ruby  

  * Same as Perl. For Windows users, I use Ruby 1.8.7 patchlevel 352. I don't know if 1.9 causes any problems. 

## A Working TeX/ConTeXt installation. 

Since I'm no TeX expert, what I'm going to tell you is based upon my personal experience. 

* Let's start by giving you some pointers: http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Installation
* On my windows machine, I use W32Tex, that can be found at http://w32tex.org/ . It's a quite comprehensive TeX distro, and it is usually up-to-date ConTeXt-wise. On Windows, ConTeXt minimal always gave me some glitches at best, some problems at worst, while W32text always worked quite well. 
* On my linux box/VM, ConTeXt minimal usually did the job. This is also my suggestion if you already have a working Tex/LaTeX distro but there is no ConTeXt installed. More infos can be found there: http://wiki.contextgarden.net/ConTeXt_Standalone
* I don't have ready access to an OSX box, but I heard that TeX-live might do the job.
